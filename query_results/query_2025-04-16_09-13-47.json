      "description": "The\novsdb-tool\nprogram is a command-line tool for managing Open\n       vSwitch database (OVSDB) files.  It does not interact directly\n       with running Open vSwitch database servers (instead, use\novsdb-client\n).  For an introduction to OVSDB and its\n       implementation in Open vSwitch, see\novsdb(7)\n.\n\n       Each command that takes an optional\ndb\nor\nschema\nargument has a\n       default file location if it is not specified..  The default\ndb\nis\n/usr/local/etc/openvswitch/conf.db\n.  The default\nschema\nis\n/usr/local/share/openvswitch/vswitch.ovsschema\n.\n\n       This OVSDB implementation supports standalone and active-backup\n       database service models with one on-disk format and a clustered\n       database service model with a different format.\novsdb-tool\nsupports both formats, but some commands are appropriate for only\n       one format, as documented for individual commands below.  For a\n       specification of these formats, see\novsdb(5)\n.  For more\n       information on OVSDB service models, see the\nService Models\nsection in\novsdb(7)\n.\nDatabase Creation Commands\nThese commands create a new OVSDB database file.  They will not\n       overwrite an existing database file.  To replace an existing\n       database with a new one, first delete the old one.\ncreate\n[\ndb\n[\nschema\n]]\n              Use this command to create the database for controlling\novs-vswitchd\nor another standalone or active-backup\n              database.  It creates database file\ndb\nwith the given\nschema\n, which must be the name of a file that contains an\n              OVSDB schema in JSON format, as specified in the OVSDB\n              specification.  The new database is initially empty.  (You\n              can use\ncp\nto copy a database including both its schema and\n              data.)\n\n       [\n--election-timer=\nms\n]\ncreate-cluster\ndb contents local\nUse this command to initialize the first server in a high-\n              availability cluster of 3 (or more) database servers, e.g.\n              for a database in an environment that cannot tolerate a\n              single point of failure.  It creates clustered database\n              file\ndb\nand configures the server to listen on\nlocal\n, which\n              must take the form\nprotocol\n:\nip\n:\nport\n, where\nprotocol\nis\ntcp\nor\nssl\n,\nip\nis the server's IP (either an IPv4 address or an\n              IPv6 address enclosed in square brackets), and\nport\nis a\n              TCP port number.  Only one address is specified, for the\n              first server in the cluster, ordinarily the one for the\n              server running\ncreate-cluster\n.  The address is used for\n              communication within the cluster, not for communicating\n              with OVSDB clients, and must not use the same port used for\n              the OVSDB protocol.\n\n              The new database is initialized with\ncontents\n, which must\n              name a file that contains either an OVSDB schema in JSON\n              format or a standalone OVSDB database.  If it is a schema\n              file, the new database will initially be empty, with the\n              given schema.  If it is a database file, the new database\n              will have the same schema and contents.\n\n              Leader election will be initiated by a follower if there is\n              no heartbeat received from the cluster leader within the\n              specified election timer.  The default leader election\n              timer is 1000 milliseconds. To use a different value when\n              creating the database, specify\n--election-timer=\nms\n, where\nms\nis a value in milliseconds between 100 and 600000\n              inclusive.\n\n       [\n--cid=\nuuid\n]\njoin-cluster\ndb name local remote\n...\n              Use this command to initialize each server after the first\n              one in an OVSDB high-availability cluster.  It creates\n              clustered database file\ndb\nfor a database named\nname\n, and\n              configures the server to listen on\nlocal\nand to initially\n              connect to\nremote\n, which must be a server that already\n              belongs to the cluster.\nlocal\nand\nremote\nuse the same\nprotocol\n:\nip\n:\nport\nsyntax as\ncreate-cluster\n.\n\n              The\nname\nmust be the name of the schema or database passed\n              to\ncreate-cluster\n.  For example, the name of the OVN\n              Southbound database schema is\nOVN_Southbound\n.  Use\novsdb-tool\n's\nschema-name\nor\ndb-name\ncommand to find out the\n              name of a schema or database, respectively.\n\n              This command does not do any network access, which means\n              that it cannot actually join the new server to the cluster.\n              Instead, the\ndb\nfile that it creates prepares the server to\n              join the cluster the first time that\novsdb-server\nserves\n              it.  As part of joining the cluster, the new server\n              retrieves the database schema and obtains the list of all\n              cluster members.  Only after that does it become a full\n              member of the cluster.\n\n              Optionally, more than one\nremote\nmay be specified; for\n              example, in a cluster that already contains multiple\n              servers, one could specify all the existing servers.  This\n              is beneficial if some of the existing servers are down\n              while the new server joins, but it is not otherwise needed.\n\n              By default, the\ndb\ncreated by\njoin-cluster\nwill join any\n              clustered database named\nname\nthat is available at a\nremote\n.  In theory, if machines go up and down and IP\n              addresses change in the right way, it could join the wrong\n              database cluster.  To avoid this possibility, specify\n--cid=\nuuid\n, where\nuuid\nis the cluster ID of the cluster to\n              join, as printed by\novsdb-tool get-cid\n.\nDatabase Migration Commands\nThis commands will convert cluster database to standalone\n       database.\ncluster-to-standalone\ndb clusterdb\nUse this command to convert to standalone database from\n              clustered database when the cluster is down and cannot be\n              revived. It creates new standalone\ndb\nfile from the given\n              cluster\ndb\nfile.\nVersion Management Commands\nAn OVSDB schema has a schema version number, and an OVSDB database\n       embeds a particular version of an OVSDB schema.  These version\n       numbers take the form\nx\n.\ny\n.\nz\n, e.g.\n1.2.3\n.  The OVSDB implementation\n       does not enforce a particular version numbering scheme, but\n       schemas managed within the Open vSwitch project use the following\n       approach.  Whenever the database schema is changed in a non-\n       backward compatible way (e.g. deleting a column or a table),\nx\nis\n       incremented (and\ny\nand\nz\nare reset to 0).  When the database\n       schema is changed in a backward compatible way (e.g. adding a new\n       column),\ny\nis incremented (and\nz\nis reset to 0).  When the\n       database schema is changed cosmetically (e.g. reindenting its\n       syntax),\nz\nis incremented.\n\n       Some OVSDB databases and schemas, especially very old ones, do not\n       have a version number.\n\n       Schema version numbers and Open vSwitch version numbers are\n       independent.\n\n       These commands work with different versions of OVSDB schemas and\n       databases.\nconvert\n[\ndb\n[\nschema\n[\ntarget\n]]]\n              Reads\ndb\n, translating it into to the schema specified in\nschema\n, and writes out the new interpretation.  If\ntarget\nis specified, the translated version is written as a new\n              file named\ntarget\n, which must not already exist.  If\ntarget\nis omitted, then the translated version of the database\n              replaces\ndb\nin-place.  In-place conversion cannot take\n              place if the database is currently being served by\novsdb-server\n(instead, either stop\novsdb-server\nfirst or\n              use\novsdb-client\n's\nconvert\ncommand).\n\n              This command can do simple ``upgrades'' and ``downgrades''\n              on a database's schema.  The data in\ndb\nmust be valid when\n              interpreted under\nschema\n, with only one exception: data in\ndb\nfor tables and columns that do not exist in\nschema\nare\n              ignored.  Columns that exist in\nschema\nbut not in\ndb\nare\n              set to their default values.  All of\nschema\n's constraints\n              apply in full.\n\n              Some uses of this command can cause unrecoverable data\n              loss.  For example, converting a database from a schema\n              that has a given column or table to one that does not will\n              delete all data in that column or table.  Back up critical\n              databases before converting them.\n\n              This command is for standalone and active-backup databases\n              only.  For clustered databases, use\novsdb-client\n's\nconvert\ncommand to convert them online.\nneeds-conversion\n[\ndb\n[\nschema\n]]\n              Reads the schema embedded in\ndb\nand the JSON schema from\nschema\nand compares them.  If the schemas are the same,\n              prints\nno\non stdout; if they differ, prints\nyes\n.\n\n              This command is for standalone and active-backup databases\n              only.  For clustered databases, use\novsdb-client\n's\nneeds-\nconversion\ncommand instead.\ndb-version\n[\ndb\n]\nschema-version\n[\nschema\n]\n              Prints the version number in the schema embedded within the\n              database\ndb\nor in the JSON schema\nschema\non stdout.  If\nschema\nor\ndb\nwas created before schema versioning was\n              introduced, then it will not have a version number and this\n              command will print a blank line.\n\n              The\ndb-version\ncommand is for standalone and active-backup\n              databases only.  For clustered databases, use\novsdb-client\n's\nschema-version\ncommand instead.\ndb-cksum\n[\ndb\n]\nschema-cksum\n[\nschema\n]\n              Prints the checksum in the schema embedded within the\n              database\ndb\nor of the JSON schema\nschema\non stdout.  If\nschema\nor\ndb\nwas created before schema checksums were\n              introduced, then it will not have a checksum and this\n              command will print a blank line.\n\n              The\ndb-cksum\ncommand is for standalone and active-backup\n              databases only.  For clustered databases, use\novsdb-client\n's\nschema-cksum\ncommand instead.\ncompare-versions\na op b\nCompares\na\nand\nb\naccording to\nop\n.  Both\na\nand\nb\nmust be\n              OVSDB schema version numbers in the form\nx\n.\ny\n.\nz\n, as\n              described in\novsdb(7)\n, and\nop\nmust be one of\n< <= == >= >\n!=\n.  If the comparison is true, exits with status 0; if it\n              is false, exits with status 2.  (Exit status 1 indicates an\n              error, e.g.\na\nor\nb\nis the wrong syntax for an OVSDB version\n              or\nop\nis not a valid comparison operator.)\nOther Commands\ncompact\n[\ndb\n[\ntarget\n]]\n              Reads\ndb\nand writes a compacted version.  If\ntarget\nis\n              specified, the compacted version is written as a new file\n              named\ntarget\n, which must not already exist.  If\ntarget\nis\n              omitted, then the compacted version of the database\n              replaces\ndb\nin-place.  This command is not needed in normal\n              operation because\novsdb-server\nfrom time to time\n              automatically compacts a database that grows much larger\n              than its minimum size.\n\n              This command does not work if\ndb\nis currently being served\n              by\novsdb-server\n, or if it is otherwise locked for writing\n              by another process.  This command also does not work with\n              clustered databases.  Instead, in either case, send the\novsdb-server/compact\ncommand to\novsdb-server\n, via\novs-appctl\n).\n\n       [\n--rbac-role=\nrole\n]\nquery\n[\ndb\n]\ntransaction\nOpens\ndb\n, executes\ntransaction\non it, and prints the\n              results.  The\ntransaction\nmust be a JSON array in the\n              format of the\nparams\narray for the JSON-RPC\ntransact\nmethod, as described in the OVSDB specification.\n\n              This command opens\ndb\nfor read-only access, so it may\n              safely run concurrently with other database activity,\n              including\novsdb-server\nand other database writers.  The\ntransaction\nmay specify database modifications, but these\n              will have no effect on\ndb\n.\n\n              By default, the transaction is executed using the\n              ``superuser'' RBAC role.  Use\n--rbac-role\nto specify a\n              different role.\n\n              This command does not work with clustered databases.\n              Instead, use\novsdb-client\n's\nquery\ncommand to send the query\n              to\novsdb-server\n.\n\n       [\n--rbac-role=\nrole\n]\ntransact\n[\ndb\n]\ntransaction\nOpens\ndb\n, executes\ntransaction\non it, prints the results,\n              and commits any changes to\ndb\n.  The\ntransaction\nmust be a\n              JSON array in the format of the\nparams\narray for the JSON-\n              RPC\ntransact\nmethod, as described in the OVSDB\n              specification.\n\n              This command does not work if\ndb\nis currently being served\n              by\novsdb-server\n, or if it is otherwise locked for writing\n              by another process.  This command also does not work with\n              clustered databases.  Instead, in either case, use\novsdb-client\n's\ntransact\ncommand to send the query to\novsdb-server\n.\n\n              By default, the transaction is executed using the\n              ``superuser'' RBAC role.  Use\n--rbac-role\nto specify a\n              different role.\n\n       [\n-m\n|\n--more\n]...\nshow-log\n[\ndb\n]\n              Prints a summary of the records in\ndb\n's log, including the\n              time and date at which each database change occurred and\n              any associated comment.  This may be useful for debugging.\n\n              To increase the verbosity of output, add\n-m\n(or\n--more\n) one\n              or more times to the command line.  With one\n-m\n,\nshow-log\nprints a summary of the records added, deleted, or modified\n              by each transaction.  With two\n-m\ns,\nshow-log\nalso prints\n              the values of the columns modified by each change to a\n              record.\n\n              This command works with standalone and active-backup\n              databases and with clustered databases, but the output\n              formats are different.\ncheck-cluster\ndb\n...\n              Reads all of the records in the supplied databases, which\n              must be collected from different servers (and ideally all\n              the servers) in a single cluster.  Checks each database for\n              self-consistency and the set together for cross-\n              consistency.  If\novsdb-tool\ndetects unusual but not\n              necessarily incorrect content, it prints a warning or\n              warnings on stdout.  If\novsdb-tool\nfind consistency errors,\n              it prints an error on stderr and exits with status 1.\n              Errors typically indicate bugs in\novsdb-server\n; please\n              consider reporting them to the Open vSwitch developers.\ndb-name\n[\ndb\n]\nschema-name\n[\nschema\n]\n              Prints the name of the schema embedded within the database\ndb\nor in the JSON schema\nschema\non stdout.\ndb-cid\ndb\nPrints the cluster ID, which is a UUID that identifies the\n              cluster, for\ndb\n.  If\ndb\nis a database newly created by\novsdb-tool cluster-join\nthat has not yet successfully\n              joined its cluster, and\n--cid\nwas not specified on the\ncluster-join\ncommand line, then this command will output an\n              error, and exit with status 2, because the cluster ID is\n              not yet known.  This command works only with clustered\n              databases.\n\n              The all-zeros UUID is not a valid cluster ID.\ndb-sid\ndb\nPrints the server ID, which is a UUID that identifies the\n              server, for\ndb\n.  This command works only with clustered\n              databases.  It works even if\ndb\nis a database newly created\n              by\novsdb-tool cluster-join\nthat has not yet successfully\n              joined its cluster.\ndb-local-address db\nPrints the local address used for database clustering for\ndb\n, in the same\nprotocol\n:\nip\n:\nport\nform used on\ncreate-cluster\nand\njoin-cluster\n.\ndb-is-clustered\ndb\ndb-is-standalone\ndb\nTests whether\ndb\nis a database file in clustered or\n              standalone format, respectively.  If so, exits with status\n              0; if not, exits with status 2.  (Exit status 1 indicates\n              an error, e.g.\ndb\nis not an OVSDB database or does not\n              exist.)",

It does not interact directly\n       with running Open vSwitch database servers (instead, use\novsdb-client\n).  For an introduction to OVSDB and its\n       implementation in Open vSwitch, see\novsdb(7)\n.\n\n       Each command that takes an optional\ndb\nor\nschema\nargument has a\n       default file location if it is not specified..  The default\ndb\nis\n/usr/local/etc/openvswitch/conf.db\n.  The default\nschema\nis\n/usr/local/share/openvswitch/vswitch.ovsschema\n.\n\n       This OVSDB implementation supports standalone and active-backup\n       database service models with one on-disk format and a clustered\n       database service model with a different format.\novsdb-tool\nsupports both formats, but some commands are appropriate for only\n       one format, as documented for individual commands below.  For a\n       specification of these formats, see\novsdb(5)\n.  For more\n       information on OVSDB service models, see the\nService Models\nsection in\novsdb(7)\n.\nDatabase Creation Commands\nThese commands create a new OVSDB database file.  They will not\n       overwrite an existing database file.  To replace an existing\n       database with a new one, first delete the old one.\ncreate\n[\ndb\n[\nschema\n]]\n              Use this command to create the database for controlling\novs-vswitchd\nor another standalone or active-backup\n              database.  It creates database file\ndb\nwith the given\nschema\n, which must be the name of a file that contains an\n              OVSDB schema in JSON format, as specified in the OVSDB\n              specification.  The new database is initially empty.  (You\n              can use\ncp\nto copy a database including both its schema and\n              data.)\n\n       [\n--election-timer=\nms\n]\ncreate-cluster\ndb contents local\nUse this command to initialize the first server in a high-\n              availability cluster of 3 (or more) database servers, e.g.\n              for a database in an environment that cannot tolerate a\n              single point of failure.  It creates clustered database\n              file\ndb\nand configures the server to listen on\nlocal\n, which\n              must take the form\nprotocol\n:\nip\n:\nport\n, where\nprotocol\nis\ntcp\nor\nssl\n,\nip\nis the server's IP (either an IPv4 address or an\n              IPv6 address enclosed in square brackets), and\nport\nis a\n              TCP port number.  Only one address is specified, for the\n              first server in the cluster, ordinarily the one for the\n              server running\ncreate-cluster\n.  The address is used for\n              communication within the cluster, not for communicating\n              with OVSDB clients, and must not use the same port used for\n              the OVSDB protocol.\n\n              The new database is initialized with\ncontents\n, which must\n              name a file that contains either an OVSDB schema in JSON\n              format or a standalone OVSDB database.  If it is a schema\n              file, the new database will initially be empty, with the\n              given schema.  If it is a database file, the new database\n              will have the same schema and contents.\n\n              Leader election will be initiated by a follower if there is\n              no heartbeat received from the cluster leader within the\n              specified election timer.  The default leader election\n              timer is 1000 milliseconds. To use a different value when\n              creating the database, specify\n--election-timer=\nms\n, where\nms\nis a value in milliseconds between 100 and 600000\n              inclusive.\n\n       [\n--cid=\nuuid\n]\njoin-cluster\ndb name local remote\n...\n              Use this command to initialize each server after the first\n              one in an OVSDB high-availability cluster.  It creates\n              clustered database file\ndb\nfor a database named\nname\n, and\n              configures the server to listen on\nlocal\nand to initially\n              connect to\nremote\n, which must be a server that already\n              belongs to the cluster.\nlocal\nand\nremote\nuse the same\nprotocol\n:\nip\n:\nport\nsyntax as\ncreate-cluster\n.\n\n              The\nname\nmust be the name of the schema or database passed\n              to\ncreate-cluster\n.  For example, the name of the OVN\n              Southbound database schema is\nOVN_Southbound\n.  Use\novsdb-tool\n's\nschema-name\nor\ndb-name\ncommand to find out the\n              name of a schema or database, respectively.\n\n              This command does not do any network access, which means\n              that it cannot actually join the new server to the cluster.\n              Instead, the\ndb\nfile that it creates prepares the server to\n              join the cluster the first time that\novsdb-server\nserves\n              it.  As part of joining the cluster, the new server\n              retrieves the database schema and obtains the list of all\n              cluster members.  Only after that does it become a full\n              member of the cluster.\n\n              Optionally, more than one\nremote\nmay be specified; for\n              example, in a cluster that already contains multiple\n              servers, one could specify all the existing servers.  This\n              is beneficial if some of the existing servers are down\n              while the new server joins, but it is not otherwise needed.\n\n              By default, the\ndb\ncreated by\njoin-cluster\nwill join any\n              clustered database named\nname\nthat is available at a\nremote\n.  In theory, if machines go up and down and IP\n              addresses change in the right way, it could join the wrong\n              database cluster.  To avoid this possibility, specify\n--cid=\nuuid\n, where\nuuid\nis the cluster ID of the cluster to\n              join, as printed by\novsdb-tool get-cid\n.\nDatabase Migration Commands\nThis commands will convert cluster database to standalone\n       database.\ncluster-to-standalone\ndb clusterdb\nUse this command to convert to standalone database from\n              clustered database when the cluster is down and cannot be\n              revived. It creates new standalone\ndb\nfile from the given\n              cluster\ndb\nfile.\nVersion Management Commands\nAn OVSDB schema has a schema version number, and an OVSDB database\n       embeds a particular version of an OVSDB schema.  These version\n       numbers take the form\nx\n.\ny\n.\nz\n, e.g.\n1.2.3\n.  The OVSDB implementation\n       does not enforce a particular version numbering scheme, but\n       schemas managed within the Open vSwitch project use the following\n       approach.  Whenever the database schema is changed in a non-\n       backward compatible way (e.g. deleting a column or a table),\nx\nis\n       incremented (and\ny\nand\nz\nare reset to 0).  When the database\n       schema is changed in a backward compatible way (e.g. adding a new\n       column),\ny\nis incremented (and\nz\nis reset to 0).  When the\n       database schema is changed cosmetically (e.g. reindenting its\n       syntax),\nz\nis incremented.\n\n       Some OVSDB databases and schemas, especially very old ones, do not\n       have a version number.\n\n       Schema version numbers and Open vSwitch version numbers are\n       independent.\n\n       These commands work with different versions of OVSDB schemas and\n       databases.\nconvert\n[\ndb\n[\nschema\n[\ntarget\n]]]\n              Reads\ndb\n, translating it into to the schema specified in\nschema\n, and writes out the new interpretation.  If\ntarget\nis specified, the translated version is written as a new\n              file named\ntarget\n, which must not already exist.  If\ntarget\nis omitted, then the translated version of the database\n              replaces\ndb\nin-place.  In-place conversion cannot take\n              place if the database is currently being served by\novsdb-server\n(instead, either stop\novsdb-server\nfirst or\n              use\novsdb-client\n's\nconvert\ncommand).\n\n              This command can do simple ``upgrades'' and ``downgrades''\n              on a database's schema.  The data in\ndb\nmust be valid when\n              interpreted under\nschema\n, with only one exception: data in\ndb\nfor tables and columns that do not exist in\nschema\nare\n              ignored.  Columns that exist in\nschema\nbut not in\ndb\nare\n              set to their default values.  All of\nschema\n's constraints\n              apply in full.\n\n              Some uses of this command can cause unrecoverable data\n              loss.  For example, converting a database from a schema\n              that has a given column or table to one that does not will\n              delete all data in that column or table.  Back up critical\n              databases before converting them.\n\n              This command is for standalone and active-backup databases\n              only.  For clustered databases, use\novsdb-client\n's\nconvert\ncommand to convert them online.\nneeds-conversion\n[\ndb\n[\nschema\n]]\n              Reads the schema embedded in\ndb\nand the JSON schema from\nschema\nand compares them.  If the schemas are the same,\n              prints\nno\non stdout; if they differ, prints\nyes\n.\n\n              This command is for standalone and active-backup databases\n              only.  For clustered databases, use\novsdb-client\n's\nneeds-\nconversion\ncommand instead.\ndb-version\n[\ndb\n]\nschema-version\n[\nschema\n]\n              Prints the version number in the schema embedded within the\n              database\ndb\nor in the JSON schema\nschema\non stdout.  If\nschema\nor\ndb\nwas created before schema versioning was\n              introduced, then it will not have a version number and this\n              command will print a blank line.\n\n              The\ndb-version\ncommand is for standalone and active-backup\n              databases only.  For clustered databases, use\novsdb-client\n's\nschema-version\ncommand instead.\ndb-cksum\n[\ndb\n]\nschema-cksum\n[\nschema\n]\n              Prints the checksum in the schema embedded within the\n              database\ndb\nor of the JSON schema\nschema\non stdout.  If\nschema\nor\ndb\nwas created before schema checksums were\n              introduced, then it will not have a checksum and this\n              command will print a blank line.\n\n              The\ndb-cksum\ncommand is for standalone and active-backup\n              databases only.  For clustered databases, use\novsdb-client\n's\nschema-cksum\ncommand instead.\ncompare-versions\na op b\nCompares\na\nand\nb\naccording to\nop\n.  Both\na\nand\nb\nmust be\n              OVSDB schema version numbers in the form\nx\n.\ny\n.\nz\n, as\n              described in\novsdb(7)\n, and\nop\nmust be one of\n< <= == >= >\n!=\n.  If the comparison is true, exits with status 0; if it\n              is false, exits with status 2.  (Exit status 1 indicates an\n              error, e.g.\na\nor\nb\nis the wrong syntax for an OVSDB version\n              or\nop\nis not a valid comparison operator.)\nOther Commands\ncompact\n[\ndb\n[\ntarget\n]]\n              Reads\ndb\nand writes a compacted version.  If\ntarget\nis\n              specified, the compacted version is written as a new file\n              named\ntarget\n, which must not already exist.  If\ntarget\nis\n              omitted, then the compacted version of the database\n              replaces\ndb\nin-place.  This command is not needed in normal\n              operation because\novsdb-server\nfrom time to time\n              automatically compacts a database that grows much larger\n              than its minimum size.\n\n              This command does not work if\ndb\nis currently being served\n              by\novsdb-server\n, or if it is otherwise locked for writing\n              by another process.  This command also does not work with\n              clustered databases.  Instead, in either case, send the\novsdb-server/compact\ncommand to\novsdb-server\n, via\novs-appctl\n).\n\n       [\n--rbac-role=\nrole\n]\nquery\n[\ndb\n]\ntransaction\nOpens\ndb\n, executes\ntransaction\non it, and prints the\n              results.

The\ntransaction\nmay specify database modifications, but these\n              will have no effect on\ndb\n.\n\n              By default, the transaction is executed using the\n              ``superuser'' RBAC role.  Use\n--rbac-role\nto specify a\n              different role.\n\n              This command does not work with clustered databases.\n              Instead, use\novsdb-client\n's\nquery\ncommand to send the query\n              to\novsdb-server\n.\n\n       [\n--rbac-role=\nrole\n]\ntransact\n[\ndb\n]\ntransaction\nOpens\ndb\n, executes\ntransaction\non it, prints the results,\n              and commits any changes to\ndb\n.

This may be useful for debugging.\n\n              To increase the verbosity of output, add\n-m\n(or\n--more\n) one\n              or more times to the command line.  With one\n-m\n,\nshow-log\nprints a summary of the records added, deleted, or modified\n              by each transaction.  With two\n-m\ns,\nshow-log\nalso prints\n              the values of the columns modified by each change to a\n              record.\n\n              This command works with standalone and active-backup\n              databases and with clustered databases, but the output\n              formats are different.\ncheck-cluster\ndb\n...\n              Reads all of the records in the supplied databases, which\n              must be collected from different servers (and ideally all\n              the servers) in a single cluster.  Checks each database for\n              self-consistency and the set together for cross-\n              consistency.  If\novsdb-tool\ndetects unusual but not\n              necessarily incorrect content, it prints a warning or\n              warnings on stdout.  If\novsdb-tool\nfind consistency errors,\n              it prints an error on stderr and exits with status 1.\n              Errors typically indicate bugs in\novsdb-server\n; please\n              consider reporting them to the Open vSwitch developers.\ndb-name\n[\ndb\n]\nschema-name\n[\nschema\n]\n              Prints the name of the schema embedded within the database\ndb\nor in the JSON schema\nschema\non stdout.\ndb-cid\ndb\nPrints the cluster ID, which is a UUID that identifies the\n              cluster, for\ndb\n.

  "response": "It's tricky to directly find the *last* deleted file in Unix because deletion doesn't inherently leave a system-wide record. However, here are some approaches, with their limitations:\n\n### 1. Using filesystem auditing (if enabled)\n\nIf your system has auditing enabled (e.g., via `auditd`), you *might* be able to find deletion events.  This is not enabled by default on most systems, and requires root privileges to configure.  Even if enabled, historical logs might have rotated.\n\n*   **Command (example, adjust based on your audit setup):**\n\n    ```bash\n    ausearch -c \"rm\" -ts today | tail -n 1\n    ```\n\n    *   **Explanation:** This searches the audit logs (`ausearch`) for commands named \"rm\" (the most common delete command), from today (`-ts today`). The output is then piped to `tail -n 1` to show only the last matching entry.\n\n    *   **Limitation:**  This only works if auditing was set up *before* the deletion, and the logs haven't been rotated. It also relies on `rm` being the command used for deletion.\n\n### 2. Leveraging \"Trash\" or \"Recycle Bin\" implementations\n\nMany desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, etc.) don't truly delete files immediately.  They move them to a \"Trash\" or \"Recycle Bin\" directory.  If the file was deleted through the GUI or a trash-aware command-line tool (like `gio trash`), you can check there.\n\n*   **Command (example for GNOME's trash):**\n\n    ```bash\n    ls -ltra ~/.local/share/Trash/files | head -n 5\n    ```\n\n    *   **Explanation:**  This lists all files in the trash directory (`~/.local/share/Trash/files`), sorted by modification time (`-t`), in reverse order (`-r`), showing all files including hidden ones (`-a`), and using a long listing format (`-l`). `head -n 5` shows the first few entries, which will be the most recently trashed.\n\n    *   **Limitation:** This *only* works if the file was deleted using a trash-aware mechanism.  `rm` bypasses this entirely.  The location of the trash directory may vary by desktop environment.\n\n### 3. Examining file system logs (advanced and unlikely to be helpful in standard setups)\n\nSome advanced file systems might offer logging or journaling that *could* theoretically be analyzed.  However, this is highly specific to the file system (ZFS, etc.) and requires deep technical knowledge to implement.  It's not a practical solution for most users.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n\n*   **`rm` is destructive:** The standard `rm` command in UNIX is designed for permanent deletion.  There is no built-in \"undelete\" functionality.\n*   **Overwriting:**  Even if you could recover a \"deleted\" file's inode, the data blocks it pointed to might have been overwritten by new files.\n\nIn summary, unless you had specific auditing or trash mechanisms in place *before* the deletion, recovering the *last* deleted file is generally not possible with standard UNIX tools.  The trash approach is the most likely to work in a typical desktop environment if the file was deleted through the GUI or a trash-aware command.\n",
