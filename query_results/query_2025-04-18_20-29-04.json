      "description": "mariadb-slap\nis a diagnostic program designed to emulate client\n       load for a mariadb server and to report the timing of each stage.\n       it works as if multiple clients are accessing the server.\n\n       invoke\nmariadb-slap\nlike this:\n\n           shell>\nmariadb-slap [\noptions\n]\nsome options such as\n--create\nor\n--query\nenable you to specify a\n       string containing an sql statement or a file containing\n       statements. if you specify a file, by default it must contain one\n       statement per line. (that is, the implicit statement delimiter is\n       the newline character.) use the\n--delimiter\noption to specify a\n       different delimiter, which enables you to specify statements that\n       span multiple lines or place multiple statements on a single line.\n       you cannot include comments in a file;\nmariadb-slap\ndoes not\n       understand them.\nmariadb-slap\nruns in three stages:\n\n        1. create schema, table, and optionally any stored programs or\n           data you want to using for the test. this stage uses a single\n           client connection.\n\n        2. run the load test. this stage can use many client connections.\n\n        3. clean up (disconnect, drop table if specified). this stage\n           uses a single client connection.\n\n       examples:\n\n       supply your own create and query sql statements, with 50 clients\n       querying and 200 selects for each:\n\n           mariadb-slap --delimiter=\";\" \\\n

with a table of two\n       int columns and three varchar columns. use five clients querying\n       20 times each. do not create the table or insert the data (that\n       is, use the previous test's

to load the create, insert, and query sql\n       statements from the specified files, where the create.sql file has\n       multiple table creation statements delimited by ';' and multiple\n       insert statements delimited by ';'. the\n--query\nfile will have\n       multiple queries delimited by ';'. run all the load statements,\n       then run all the queries in the query file with five clients (five\n       times each):\n\n           mariadb-slap --concurrency=5 \\\n             --iterations=5 --query=query.sql --create=create.sql \\\n

useful when merging\n               multiple\nsudoers\nfiles, which can generate a large number\n               of warnings.\n-m\nfilter\n,\n--match\n=\nfilter\nonly output rules that match the specified\nfilter\n.  a\nfilter\nexpression is made up of one or more\nkey =\nvalue\npairs, separated by a comma (\u00e2\u0080\u0098,\u00e2\u0080\u0099).  the\nkey\nmay be \u00e2\u0080\u009ccmnd\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n               (or \u00e2\u0080\u009ccmd\u00e2\u0080\u009d), \u00e2\u0080\u009chost\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgroup\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cuser\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  for example,\nuser\n=\noperator\nor\nhost\n=\nwww\n.  an upper-case\ncmnd_alias\n,\nhost_alias\n, or\nuser_alias\nmay be specified as the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccmnd\u00e2\u0080\u009d,\n               \u00e2\u0080\u009chost\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cuser\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n               a matching\nsudoers\nrule may also include users, groups,\n               and hosts that are not part of the\nfilter\n.  this can\n               happen when a rule includes multiple users, groups, or\n               hosts.  to prune out any non-matching user, group, or host\n               from the rules, the\n-p\noption may be used.\n\n               by default, the password and group databases are not\n               consulted when matching against the filter so the users\n               and groups do not need to be present on the local system\n               (see the\n-m\noption).  only aliases that are referenced by\n               the filtered policy rules will be displayed.\n-m\n,\n--match-local\nwhen the\n-m\noption is also specified, use password and\n               group database information when matching users and groups\n               in the filter.  only users and groups in the filter that\n               exist on the local system will match, and a user's groups\n               will automatically be added to the filter.  if the\n-m\nis\nnot\nspecified, users and groups in the filter do not need\n               to exist on the local system, but all groups used for\n               matching must be explicitly listed in the filter.\n-o\noutput_file\n,\n--output\n=\noutput_file\nwrite the converted output to\noutput_file\n.  if no\noutput_file\nis specified, or if it is \u00e2\u0080\u0098-\u00e2\u0080\u0099, the converted\nsudoers\npolicy will be written to the standard output.\n-o\nstart_point\n,\n--order-start\n=\nstart_point\nwhen generating ldif output, use the number specified by\nstart_point\nin the sudoorder attribute of the first\n               sudorole object.  subsequent sudorole object use a\n               sudoorder value generated by adding an\nincrement\n, see the\n-i\noption for details.  defaults to a starting point of 1.\n               a starting point of 0 will disable the generation of\n               sudoorder attributes in the resulting ldif file.\n--passwd-file\n=\nfile\nwhen the\n-m\noption is also specified, perform passwd\n               queries using\nfile\ninstead of the system passwd database.\n-p\n,\n--prune-matches\nwhen the\n-m\noption is also specified,\ncvtsudoers\nwill\n               prune out non-matching users, groups, and hosts from\n               matching entries.\n-p\npadding\n,\n--padding\n=\npadding\nwhen generating ldif output, construct the initial\n               sudoorder value by concatenating\norder_start\nand\nincrement\n, padding the\nincrement\nwith zeros until it\n               consists of\npadding\ndigits.  for example, if\norder_start\nis 1027,\npadding\nis 3, and\nincrement\nis 1, the value of\n               sudoorder for the first entry will be 1027000, followed by\n               1027001, 1027002, etc.  if the number of sudorole entries\n               is larger than the padding would allow,\ncvtsudoers\nwill\n               exit with an error.  by default, no padding is performed.\n-s\nsections\n,\n--suppress\n=\nsections\nsuppress the output of specific\nsections\nof the security\n               policy.  one or more section names may be specified,\n               separated by a comma (\u00e2\u0080\u0098,\u00e2\u0080\u0099).  the supported section name\n               are:\ndefaults\n,\naliases\nand\nprivileges\n(which may be\n               shortened to\nprivs\n).\n-v\n,\n--version\nprint the\ncvtsudoers\nand\nsudoers\ngrammar versions and\n               exit.\nmerging multiple files\nwhen multiple input files are specified,\ncvtsudoers\nwill attempt\n       to merge them into a single policy file.  it is assumed that user\n       and group names are consistent among the policy files to be\n       merged.  for example, user \u00e2\u0080\u009cbob\u00e2\u0080\u009d on one host is the same as user\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009cbob\u00e2\u0080\u009d on another host.\n\n       when merging policy files, it is possible to prefix the input file\n       name with a host name, separated by a colon (\u00e2\u0080\u0098:\u00e2\u0080\u0099).  when the files\n       are merged, the host name will be used to restrict the policy\n       rules to that specific host where possible.\n\n       the merging process is performed as follows:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\neach input file is parsed into internal sudoers data\n          structures.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\naliases are merged and renamed as necessary to avoid conflicts.\n          in the event of a conflict, the first alias found is left as-is\n          and subsequent aliases of the same name are renamed with a\n          numeric suffix separated with a underscore (\u00e2\u0080\u0098_\u00e2\u0080\u0099).  for example,\n          if there are two different aliases named servers, the first\n          will be left as-is and the second will be renamed servers_1.\n          references to the renamed alias are also updated in the policy\n          file.  duplicate aliases (those with identical contents) are\n          pruned.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\ndefaults settings are merged and duplicates are removed.  if\n          there are conflicts in the defaults settings, a warning is\n          emitted for each conflict.  if a host name is specified with\n          the input file,\ncvtsudoers\nwill change the global defaults\n          settings in that file to be host-specific.  a warning is\n          emitted for command, user, or runas-specific defaults settings\n          which cannot be made host-specific.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nper-user rules are merged and duplicates are removed.  if a\n          host name is specified with the input file,\ncvtsudoers\nwill\n          change rules that specify a host name of\nall\nto the host name\n          associated with the policy file being merged.  the merging of\n          rules is currently fairly simplistic but will be improved in a\n          later release.\n\n       it is possible to merge policy files with differing formats.\nthe cvtsudoers.conf file\noptions in the form \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeyword =

exit.\n-i\ninput_format\n,\n--input-format\n=\ninput_format\nspecify the input format.  the following formats are\n               supported:\n\n               ldif     ldif (ldap data interchange format) files can be\n                        exported from an ldap server to convert security\n                        policies used by\nsudoers.ldap\n(5).  if a base dn\n                        (distinguished name) is specified, only sudorole\n                        objects that match the base dn will be processed.\n                        not all sudooptions specified in a sudorole can\n                        be translated from ldif to sudoers format.\n\n               sudoers  traditional sudoers format.  this is the default\n                        input format.\n-i\nincrement\n,\n--increment\n=\nincrement\nwhen generating ldif output, increment each sudoorder\n               attribute by the specified number.  defaults to an\n               increment of 1.\n-l\nlog_file\n,\n--logfile\n=\nlog_file\nlog conversion warnings to\nlog_file\ninstead of to the\n               standard error.  this is particularly useful when merging\n               multiple\nsudoers\nfiles, which can generate a large number\n               of warnings.\n-m\nfilter\n,\n--match\n=\nfilter\nonly output rules that match the specified\nfilter\n.  a\nfilter\nexpression is made up of one or more\nkey =\nvalue\npairs, separated by a comma (\u00e2\u0080\u0098,\u00e2\u0080\u0099).  the\nkey\nmay be \u00e2\u0080\u009ccmnd\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n               (or \u00e2\u0080\u009ccmd\u00e2\u0080\u009d), \u00e2\u0080\u009chost\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgroup\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cuser\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  for example,\nuser\n=\noperator\nor\nhost\n=\nwww\n.  an upper-case\ncmnd_alias\n,\nhost_alias\n, or\nuser_alias\nmay be specified as the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccmnd\u00e2\u0080\u009d,\n               \u00e2\u0080\u009chost\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cuser\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n               a matching\nsudoers\nrule may also include users, groups,\n               and hosts that are not part of the\nfilter\n.  this can\n               happen when a rule includes multiple users, groups, or\n               hosts.  to prune out any non-matching user, group, or host\n               from the rules, the\n-p\noption may be used.\n\n               by default, the password and group databases are not\n               consulted when matching against the filter so the users\n               and groups do not need to be present on the local system\n               (see the\n-m\noption).  only aliases that are referenced by\n               the filtered policy rules will be displayed.\n-m\n,\n--match-local\nwhen the\n-m\noption is also specified, use password and\n               group database information when matching users and groups\n               in the filter.  only users and groups in the filter that\n               exist on the local system will match, and a user's groups\n               will automatically be added to the filter.  if the\n-m\nis\nnot\nspecified, users and groups in the filter do not need\n               to exist on the local system, but all groups used for\n               matching must be explicitly listed in the filter.\n-o\noutput_file\n,\n--output\n=\noutput_file\nwrite the converted output to\noutput_file\n.  if no\noutput_file\nis specified, or if it is \u00e2\u0080\u0098-\u00e2\u0080\u0099, the converted\nsudoers\npolicy will be written to the standard output.\n-o\nstart_point\n,\n--order-start\n=\nstart_point\nwhen generating ldif output, use the number specified by\nstart_point\nin the sudoorder attribute of the first\n               sudorole object.  subsequent sudorole object use a\n               sudoorder value generated by adding an\nincrement\n, see the\n-i\noption for details.  defaults to a starting point of 1.\n               a starting point of 0 will disable the generation of\n               sudoorder attributes in the resulting ldif file.\n--passwd-file\n=\nfile\nwhen the\n-m\noption is also specified, perform passwd\n               queries using\nfile\ninstead of the system passwd database.\n-p\n,\n--prune-matches\nwhen the\n-m\noption is also specified,\ncvtsudoers\nwill\n               prune out non-matching users, groups, and hosts from\n               matching entries.\n-p\npadding\n,\n--padding\n=\npadding\nwhen generating ldif output, construct the initial\n               sudoorder value by concatenating\norder_start\nand\nincrement\n, padding the\nincrement\nwith zeros until it\n               consists of\npadding\ndigits.  for example, if\norder_start\nis 1027,\npadding\nis 3, and\nincrement\nis 1, the value of\n               sudoorder for the first entry will be 1027000, followed by\n               1027001, 1027002, etc.  if the number of sudorole entries\n               is larger than the padding would allow,\ncvtsudoers\nwill\n               exit with an error.  by default, no padding is performed.\n-s\nsections\n,\n--suppress\n=\nsections\nsuppress the output of specific\nsections\nof the security\n               policy.  one or more section names may be specified,\n               separated by a comma (\u00e2\u0080\u0098,\u00e2\u0080\u0099).  the supported section name\n               are:\ndefaults\n,\naliases\nand\nprivileges\n(which may be\n               shortened to\nprivs\n).\n-v\n,\n--version\nprint the\ncvtsudoers\nand\nsudoers\ngrammar versions and\n               exit.\nmerging multiple files\nwhen multiple input files are specified,\ncvtsudoers\nwill attempt\n       to merge them into a single policy file.  it is assumed that user\n       and group names are consistent among the policy files to be\n       merged.  for example, user \u00e2\u0080\u009cbob\u00e2\u0080\u009d on one host is the same as user\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009cbob\u00e2\u0080\u009d on another host.\n\n       when merging policy files, it is possible to prefix the input file\n       name with a host name, separated by a colon (\u00e2\u0080\u0098:\u00e2\u0080\u0099).  when the files\n       are merged, the host name will be used to restrict the policy\n       rules to that specific host where possible.\n\n       the merging process is performed as follows:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\neach input file is parsed into internal sudoers data\n          structures.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\naliases are merged and renamed as necessary to avoid conflicts.\n          in the event of a conflict, the first alias found is left as-is\n          and subsequent aliases of the same name are renamed with a\n          numeric suffix separated with a underscore (\u00e2\u0080\u0098_\u00e2\u0080\u0099).  for example,\n          if there are two different aliases named servers, the first\n          will be left as-is and the second will be renamed servers_1.\n          references to the renamed alias are also updated in the policy\n          file.  duplicate aliases (those with identical contents) are\n          pruned.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\ndefaults settings are merged and duplicates are removed.  if\n          there are conflicts in the defaults settings, a warning is\n          emitted for each conflict.  if a host name is specified with\n          the input file,\ncvtsudoers\nwill change the global defaults\n          settings in that file to be host-specific.  a warning is\n          emitted for command, user, or runas-specific defaults settings\n          which cannot be made host-specific.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nper-user rules are merged and duplicates are removed.  if a\n          host name is specified with the input file,\ncvtsudoers\nwill\n          change rules that specify a host name of\nall\nto the host name\n          associated with the policy file being merged.  the merging of\n          rules is currently fairly simplistic but will be improved in a\n          later release.\n\n       it is possible to merge policy files with differing formats.\nthe cvtsudoers.conf file\noptions in the form \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeyword = value\u00e2\u0080\u009d may also be specified in a\n       configuration
