      "description": "this manual page documents version 5.46 of the\nfile\ncommand.\nfile\ntests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  there are\n       three sets of tests, performed in this order: filesystem tests,\n       magic tests, and language tests.  the\nfirst\ntest that succeeds\n       causes the file type to be printed.\n\n       the type printed will usually contain one of the words\ntext\n(the\n       file contains only printing characters and a few common control\n       characters and is probably safe to read on an ascii terminal),\nexecutable\n(the file contains the result of compiling a program in\n       a form understandable to some unix kernel or another), or\ndata\nmeaning anything else (data is usually \u00e2\u0080\u009cbinary\u00e2\u0080\u009d or non-printable).\n       exceptions are well-known file formats (core files, tar archives)\n       that are known to contain binary data.  when modifying magic files\n       or the program itself, make sure to\npreserve these keywords\n.\n       users depend on knowing that all the readable files in a directory\n       have the word \u00e2\u0080\u009ctext\u00e2\u0080\u009d printed.  don't do as berkeley did and change\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009cshell commands text\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cshell script\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n       the filesystem tests are based on examining the return from a\nstat\n(2) system call.  the program checks to see if the file is\n       empty, or if it's some sort of special file.  any known file types\n       appropriate to the system you are running on (sockets, symbolic\n       links, or named pipes (fifos) on those systems that implement\n       them) are intuited if they are defined in the system header file\n       <\nsys/stat.h\n>.\n\n       the magic tests are used to check for files with data in\n       particular fixed formats.  the canonical example of this is a\n       binary executable (compiled program) a.out file, whose format is\n       defined in <\nelf.h\n>, <\na.out.h\n> and possibly <\nexec.h\n> in the\n       standard include directory.  these files have a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmagic number\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n       stored in a particular place near the beginning of the file that\n       tells the unix operating system that the file is a binary\n       executable, and which of several types thereof.  the concept of a\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009cmagic number\u00e2\u0080\u009d has been applied by extension to data files.  any\n       file with some invariant identifier at a small fixed offset into\n       the file can usually be described in this way.  the information\n       identifying these files is read from the compiled magic file\n/usr/local/share/misc/magic.mgc\n, or the files in the directory\n/usr/local/share/misc/magic\nif the compiled file does not exist.\n       in addition, if\n$home/.magic.mgc\nor\n$home/.magic\nexists, it will\n       be used in preference to the system magic files.\n\n       if a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it\n       is examined to see if it seems to be a text file.  ascii,\n       iso-8859-x, non-iso 8-bit extended-ascii character sets (such as\n       those used on macintosh and ibm pc systems), utf-8-encoded\n       unicode, utf-16-encoded unicode, and ebcdic character sets can be\n       distinguished by the different ranges and sequences of bytes that\n       constitute printable text in each set.  if a file passes any of\n       these tests, its character set is reported.  ascii, iso-8859-x,\n       utf-8, and extended-ascii files are identified as \u00e2\u0080\u009ctext\u00e2\u0080\u009d because\n       they will be mostly readable on nearly any terminal; utf-16 and\n       ebcdic are only \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharacter data\u00e2\u0080\u009d because, while they contain text,\n       it is text that will require translation before it can be read.\n       in addition,\nfile\nwill attempt to determine other characteristics\n       of text-type files.  if the lines of a file are terminated by cr,\n       crlf, or nel, instead of the unix-standard lf, this will be\n       reported.  files that contain embedded escape sequences or\n       overstriking will also be identified.\n\n       once\nfile\nhas determined the character set used in a text-type\n       file, it will attempt to determine in what language the file is\n       written.  the language tests look for particular strings (cf.\n       <\nnames.h\n>) that can appear anywhere in the first few blocks of a\n       file.  for example, the keyword\n.br\nindicates that the file is\n       most likely a\ntroff\n(1) input file, just as the keyword\nstruct\nindicates a c program.  these tests are less reliable than the\n       previous two groups, so they are performed last.  the language\n       test routines also test for some miscellany (such as\ntar\n(1)\n       archives, json files).\n\n       any file that cannot be identified as having been written in any\n       of the character sets listed above is simply said to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cdata\u00e2\u0080\u009d.",

utf-16 and\n       ebcdic are only \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharacter data\u00e2\u0080\u009d because, while they contain text,\n       it is text that will require translation before it can be read.\n       in addition,\nfile\nwill attempt to determine other characteristics\n       of text-type files.  if the lines of a file are terminated by cr,\n       crlf, or nel, instead of the unix-standard lf, this will be\n       reported.  files that contain embedded escape sequences or\n       overstriking will also be identified.\n\n       once\nfile\nhas determined the character set used in a text-type\n       file, it will attempt to determine in what language the file is\n       written.  the language tests look for particular strings (cf.\n       <\nnames.h\n>) that can appear anywhere in the first few blocks of a\n       file.  for example, the keyword\n.br\nindicates that the file is\n       most likely a\ntroff\n(1) input file, just as the keyword\nstruct\nindicates a c program.  these tests are less reliable than the\n       previous two groups, so they are performed last.  the language\n       test routines also test for some miscellany (such as\ntar\n(1)\n       archives, json files).\n\n       any file that cannot be identified as having been written in any\n       of the character sets listed above is simply said to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cdata\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n---\n\nCommand: vdir\nDescription: list information about the files (the current directory by\n       default).  sort entries alphabetically if none of\n-cftuvsux\nnor\n--sort\nis specified.\n\n       mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short\n       options too.\n-a\n,\n--all\ndo not ignore entries starting with .\n-a\n,\n--almost-all\ndo not list implied . and ..\n--author\nwith\n-l\n, print the author of each file\n-b\n,\n--escape\nprint c-style escapes for nongraphic characters\n--block-size\n=\nsize\nwith\n-l\n, scale sizes by size when printing them;

The inner `find` command finds only files (`-type f`) within the current directory (`-maxdepth 1`).  `wc -l` counts the number of lines (files).\n    *   `sort -rn -k2`: Sorts the output numerically (`-n`) in reverse order (`-r`) based on the second field (`-k2`), which is the file count.\n\nThis pipeline efficiently lists each directory and the number of files it contains, then sorts the output by the number of files in descending order.\n",
