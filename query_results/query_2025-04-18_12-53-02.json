      "description": "Quilt\nis a tool to manage large sets of patches by keeping track\n       of the changes each patch makes.  Patches can be applied,\n       unapplied, refreshed, and so forth.  The key philosophical concept\n       is that your primary working material is patches.\n\n       With\nquilt\n, all work occurs within a single directory tree.\n       Commands can be invoked from anywhere within the source tree.\n       Like\nCVS\n,\nSubversion\n, or\nGit\n,\nquilt\ntakes commands of the form\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt\ncommand\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  A command can be truncated (abbreviated) as long\n       as the specified part of the command is unambiguous.  If\ncommand\nis ambiguously short,\nquilt\nlists all commands matching that\n       prefix and exits.  All commands print a brief contextual help\n       message and exit if given the \u00e2\u0080\u009c-h\u00e2\u0080\u009d option.\nQuilt\nmanages a stack of patches.  Patches are applied\n       incrementally on top of the base tree plus all preceding patches.\n       They can be pushed onto the stack (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt push\u00e2\u0080\u009d), and popped off\n       the stack (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt pop\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  Commands are available for querying the\n       contents of the stack (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt applied\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt previous\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt\n       top\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and the patches that are not applied at a particular moment\n       (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt next\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt unapplied\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  By default, most commands\n       apply to the topmost patch on the stack.\n\n       Patch files are located in the\npatches\nsubdirectory of the source\n       tree (see\nExample of working tree\n, under\nFILES\n, below).  The\nQUILT_PATCHES\nenvironment variable overrides this default\n       location.  When not found in the current directory, that\n       subdirectory is searched recursively in the parent directories\n       (this is similar to the way\nGit\nsearches for its configuration\n       files).  The\npatches\ndirectory may contain subdirectories.  It may\n       also be a symbolic link instead of a directory.\nQuilt\ncreates and maintains a file called\nseries\n, which defines\n       the order in which patches are applied.  The\nQUILT_SERIES\nenvironment variable overrides this default name.  You can query\n       the contents of the series file at any time with \u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt series\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n       In this file, each patch file name is on a separate line.  Patch\n       files are identified by path names that are relative to the\npatches\ndirectory; patches may be in subdirectories below this\n       directory.  Lines in the series file that start with a hash\n       character (#) are ignored.  Patch options, such as the strip level\n       or whether the patch is reversed, can be added after each patch\n       file name.  Options are introduced by a space, separated by\n       spaces, and follow the syntax of the patch(1) options (e.g.,\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009c-p2\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  Quilt records patch options automatically when a command\n       supporting them is used.  Without options, strip level 1 is\n       assumed.  You can also add a comment after each patch file name\n       and options, introduced by a space followed by a hash character.\n       When\nquilt\nadds, removes, or renames patches, it automatically\n       updates the series file.  Users of\nquilt\ncan modify series files\n       while some patches are applied, as long as the applied patches\n       remain in their original order.  Unless there are means by which a\n       series file can be generated automatically, you should provide it\n       along with any set of\nquilt\n-managed patches you distribute.\n       Different series files can be used to assemble patches in\n       different ways, corresponding (for example) to different\n       development branches.\n\n       Before a patch is applied, copies of all files the patch modifies\n       are saved to the\n.pc/\npatch-name directory, where\npatch-name\nis the\n       name of the patch (for example,\nfix-buffer-overflow.patch\n).  The\n       patch is added to the list of currently applied patches\n       (\n.pc/applied-patches\n).  Later, when a patch is regenerated (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt\n       refresh\u00e2\u0080\u009d), the backup copies in\n.pc/\npatch-name are compared with\n       the current versions of the files in the source tree using GNU\ndiff(1)\n.\n\n       A similar process occurs when starting a new patch (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt new\u00e2\u0080\u009d);\n       the new patch file name is added to the series file.  A file to be\n       changed by the patch is backed up and opened for editing (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt\n       edit\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  After editing, inspect the impact of your changes (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt\n       diff\u00e2\u0080\u009d); the changes stay local to your working tree until you call\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt refresh\u00e2\u0080\u009d to write them to the patch file.\n\n       Documentation related to a patch can be put at the beginning of\n       its patch file (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt header\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\nQuilt\nis careful to preserve all\n       text that precedes the actual patch when doing a refresh.  (This\n       is limited to patches in unified format; see the GNU\nDiffutils\nmanual.)\n\n       The series file is looked up in the\n.pc\ndirectory, in the root of\n       the source tree, and in the patches directory.  The first series\n       file that is found is used.  This may also be a symbolic link, or\n       a file with multiple hard links.  Usually, only one series file is\n       used for a set of patches, making the patches subdirectory a\n       convenient location.\n\n       The\n.pc\ndirectory cannot be relocated, but it can be a symbolic\n       link.  Its subdirectories must not be renamed or restructured.\n       While patches are applied to the source tree, this directory is\n       essential for many operations, including popping patches off the\n       stack and refreshing them.  Files in the\n.pc\ndirectory are\n       automatically removed when they are no longer needed, so there is\n       no need to clean up manually.\nQuilt commands reference\nadd\n[-P patch] {file} ...\n\n           Add one or more files to the topmost or named patch.

Forking a patch means creating a\n           verbatim copy of it under a new name, and use that new name\n           instead of the original one in the current series.  This is\n           useful when a patch has to be modified, but the original\n           version of it should be preserved, e.g.  because it is used in\n           another series, or for the history.  A typical sequence of\n           commands would be: fork, edit, refresh.\n\n           If new_name is missing, the name of the forked patch will be\n           the current patch name, followed by `-2'.  If the patch name\n           already ends in a dash-and-number, the number is further\n           incremented (e.g., patch.diff, patch-2.diff, patch-3.diff).\ngraph\n[--all] [--reduce] [--lines[=num]] [--edge-labels=files] [-T\n       ps] [patch]\n\n           Generate a dot(1) directed graph showing the dependencies\n           between applied patches.

When this\n               option is used, the editor will not be invoked, and the\n               patches will be processed immediately.\n\n           -M file\n\n               Like the -m option, but read the introduction from file.\n\n           --prefix prefix\n\n               Use an alternate prefix in the bracketed part of the\n               subjects generated. Defaults to `patch'.\n\n           --mbox file\n\n               Store all messages in the specified file in mbox format.\n               The mbox can later be sent using formail, for example.\n\n           --send\n\n               Send the messages directly.\n\n           --sender\n\n               The envelope sender address to use. The address must be of\n               the form `user@domain.name'. No display name is allowed.\n\n           --from, --subject\n\n               The values for the From and Subject headers to use. If no\n               --from option is given, the value of the --sender option\n               is used.\n\n           --to, --cc, --bcc\n\n               Append a recipient to the To, Cc, or Bcc header.\n\n           --charset\n\n               Specify a particular message encoding on systems which\n               don't use UTF-8 or ISO-8859-15. This character encoding\n               must match the one used in the patches.\n\n           --signature file\n\n               Append the specified signature to messages (defaults to\n               ~/.signature if found; use `-' for no signature).\n\n           --reply-to message\n\n               Add the appropriate headers to reply to the specified\n               message.\nnew\n[-p n] {patchname}\n\n           Create a new patch with the specified file name, and insert it\n           after the topmost patch. The name can be prefixed with a sub-\n           directory name, allowing for grouping related patches\n           together.\n\n           -p n\n               Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 are supported).\n\n               Quilt can be used in sub-directories of a source tree. It\n               determines the root of a source tree by searching for a\n               directory above the current working directory. Create a\n               directory in the intended root directory if quilt chooses\n               a top-level directory that is too high up in the directory\n               tree.\nnext\n[patch]\n\n           Print the name of the next patch after the specified or\n           topmost patch in the series file.\npatches\n[-v] [--color[=always|auto|never]] {file} [files...]\n\n           Print the list of patches that modify any of the specified\n           files.

This is a design\n               limitation due to the fact that quilt can only operate on\n               patches. If other commands in the %prep section modify the\n               patched files, they must come first, otherwise you won't\n               be able to push the patch series.\n\n               For example, a %prep section where you first unpack a\n               tarball, then apply patches, and lastly perform a tree-\n               wide string substitution, is not OK. For \"quilt setup\" to\n               work, it would have to be changed to unpacking the\n               tarball, then performing the tree-wide string\n               substitution, and lastly applying the patches.\nsnapshot\n[-d]\n\n           Take a snapshot of the current working state.  After taking\n           the snapshot, the tree can be modified in the usual ways,\n           including pushing and popping patches.  A diff against the\n           tree at the moment of the snapshot can be generated with\n           `quilt diff --snapshot'.\n\n           -d  Only remove current snapshot.\ntop\nPrint the name of the topmost patch on the current stack of\n           applied patches.\nunapplied\n[patch]\n\n           Print a list of patches that are not applied, or all patches\n           that follow the specified patch in the series file.\nupgrade\nUpgrade the meta-data in a working tree from an old version of\n           quilt to the current version. This command is only needed when\n           the quilt meta-data format has changed, and the working tree\n           still contains old-format meta-data. In that case, quilt will\n           request to run `quilt upgrade'.",

Patches can be applied,\n       unapplied, refreshed, and so forth.  The key philosophical concept\n       is that your primary working material is patches.\n\n       With\nquilt\n, all work occurs within a single directory tree.\n       Commands can be invoked from anywhere within the source tree.\n       Like\nCVS\n,\nSubversion\n, or\nGit\n,\nquilt\ntakes commands of the form\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt\ncommand\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  A command can be truncated (abbreviated) as long\n       as the specified part of the command is unambiguous.  If\ncommand\nis ambiguously short,\nquilt\nlists all commands matching that\n       prefix and exits.  All commands print a brief contextual help\n       message and exit if given the \u00e2\u0080\u009c-h\u00e2\u0080\u009d option.\nQuilt\nmanages a stack of patches.  Patches are applied\n       incrementally on top of the base tree plus all preceding patches.\n       They can be pushed onto the stack (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt push\u00e2\u0080\u009d), and popped off\n       the stack (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt pop\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  Commands are available for querying the\n       contents of the stack (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt applied\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt previous\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt\n       top\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and the patches that are not applied at a particular moment\n       (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt next\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt unapplied\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  By default, most commands\n       apply to the topmost patch on the stack.\n\n       Patch files are located in the\npatches\nsubdirectory of the source\n       tree (see\nExample of working tree\n, under\nFILES\n, below).  The\nQUILT_PATCHES\nenvironment variable overrides this default\n       location.  When not found in the current directory, that\n       subdirectory is searched recursively in the parent directories\n       (this is similar to the way\nGit\nsearches for its configuration\n       files).  The\npatches\ndirectory may contain subdirectories.  It may\n       also be a symbolic link instead of a directory.\nQuilt\ncreates and maintains a file called\nseries\n, which defines\n       the order in which patches are applied.  The\nQUILT_SERIES\nenvironment variable overrides this default name.  You can query\n       the contents of the series file at any time with \u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt series\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n       In this file, each patch file name is on a separate line.  Patch\n       files are identified by path names that are relative to the\npatches\ndirectory; patches may be in subdirectories below this\n       directory.  Lines in the series file that start with a hash\n       character (#) are ignored.  Patch options, such as the strip level\n       or whether the patch is reversed, can be added after each patch\n       file name.  Options are introduced by a space, separated by\n       spaces, and follow the syntax of the patch(1) options (e.g.,\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009c-p2\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  Quilt records patch options automatically when a command\n       supporting them is used.  Without options, strip level 1 is\n       assumed.  You can also add a comment after each patch file name\n       and options, introduced by a space followed by a hash character.\n       When\nquilt\nadds, removes, or renames patches, it automatically\n       updates the series file.  Users of\nquilt\ncan modify series files\n       while some patches are applied, as long as the applied patches\n       remain in their original order.  Unless there are means by which a\n       series file can be generated automatically, you should provide it\n       along with any set of\nquilt\n-managed patches you distribute.\n       Different series files can be used to assemble patches in\n       different ways, corresponding (for example) to different\n       development branches.\n\n       Before a patch is applied, copies of all files the patch modifies\n       are saved to the\n.pc/\npatch-name directory, where\npatch-name\nis the\n       name of the patch (for example,\nfix-buffer-overflow.patch\n).  The\n       patch is added to the list of currently applied patches\n       (\n.pc/applied-patches\n).  Later, when a patch is regenerated (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt\n       refresh\u00e2\u0080\u009d), the backup copies in\n.pc/\npatch-name are compared with\n       the current versions of the files in the source tree using GNU\ndiff(1)\n.\n\n       A similar process occurs when starting a new patch (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt new\u00e2\u0080\u009d);\n       the new patch file name is added to the series file.  A file to be\n       changed by the patch is backed up and opened for editing (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt\n       edit\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  After editing, inspect the impact of your changes (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt\n       diff\u00e2\u0080\u009d); the changes stay local to your working tree until you call\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt refresh\u00e2\u0080\u009d to write them to the patch file.\n\n       Documentation related to a patch can be put at the beginning of\n       its patch file (\u00e2\u0080\u009cquilt header\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\nQuilt\nis careful to preserve all\n       text that precedes the actual patch when doing a refresh.  (This\n       is limited to patches in unified format; see the GNU\nDiffutils\nmanual.)\n\n       The series file is looked up in the\n.pc\ndirectory, in the root of\n       the source tree, and in the patches directory.  The first series\n       file that is found is used.  This may also be a symbolic link, or\n       a file with multiple hard links.  Usually, only one series file is\n       used for a set of patches, making the patches subdirectory a\n       convenient location.\n\n       The\n.pc\ndirectory cannot be relocated, but it can be a symbolic\n       link.  Its subdirectories must not be renamed or restructured.\n       While patches are applied to the source tree, this directory is\n       essential for many operations, including popping patches off the\n       stack and refreshing them.  Files in the\n.pc\ndirectory are\n       automatically removed when they are no longer needed, so there is\n       no need to clean up manually.\nQuilt commands reference\nadd\n[-P patch] {file} ...\n\n           Add one or more files to the topmost or named patch.

Forking a patch means creating a\n           verbatim copy of it under a new name, and use that new name\n           instead of the original one in the current series.  This is\n           useful when a patch has to be modified, but the original\n           version of it should be preserved, e.g.  because it is used in\n           another series, or for the history.  A typical sequence of\n           commands would be: fork, edit, refresh.\n\n           If new_name is missing, the name of the forked patch will be\n           the current patch name, followed by `-2'.  If the patch name\n           already ends in a dash-and-number, the number is further\n           incremented (e.g., patch.diff, patch-2.diff, patch-3.diff).\ngraph\n[--all] [--reduce] [--lines[=num]] [--edge-labels=files] [-T\n       ps] [patch]\n\n           Generate a dot(1) directed graph showing the dependencies\n           between applied patches.

Unless otherwise specified, the graph\n           includes all patches that the topmost patch depends on.  When\n           a patch name is specified, instead of the topmost patch,\n           create a graph for the specified patch.

For \"quilt setup\" to\n               work, it would have to be changed to unpacking the\n               tarball, then performing the tree-wide string\n               substitution, and lastly applying the patches.\nsnapshot\n[-d]\n\n           Take a snapshot of the current working state.

  "response": "To remove all text files in a directory, you can use the `find` command in conjunction with the `rm` command.\n\n*   **Command:** `find` and `rm`\n*   **Explanation:** The `find` command locates files based on specified criteria (e.g., name, type). The `-exec` option then allows you to execute another command (in this case, `rm`) on the files found.\n\n```bash\nfind /path/to/directory -type f -name \"*.txt\" -exec rm {} \\;\n```\n\n*   `-type f`:  Specifies that you're only looking for files.\n*   `-name \"*.txt\"`: Specifies the files must end in \".txt\".\n\n    *   `-exec rm {} \\;`: Executes the `rm` command on each file found. The `{}` is a placeholder for the found file, and `\\;` marks the end of the command.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n1.  **Remove all `.txt` files in `/home/user/documents`:**\n\n```bash\nfind /home/user/documents -type f -name \"*.txt\" -exec rm {} \\;\n```\n\n2.  **Remove all `.md` and `.log` files in `/var/log`:**\n\n```bash\nfind /var/log -type f \\( -name \"*.md\" -o -name \"*.log\" \\) -exec rm {} \\;\n```\n\n**Important Flags/Options:**\n\n*   `-i`:  Add this option to the `rm` command for interactive deletion, which prompts you to confirm each deletion:\n\n```bash\nfind /path/to/directory -type f -name \"*.txt\" -exec rm -i {} \\;\n```\n\n*   `-r` or `-R`: These options are used for recursively deleting directories and their contents.  Be very careful when using these options, especially in conjunction with `find`, as they can lead to unintentional data loss.  Since the user is asking about *files*, these are likely not needed.\n",
