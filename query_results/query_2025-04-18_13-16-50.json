If\n               a write error occurred in step 3d, it is unspecified if\ncp\ncontinues with any remaining files.

The\ndest_file\nshall be created with the same file type as\nsource_file\n.\n\n            b. If\nsource_file\nis a file of type FIFO, the file permission\n               bits shall be the same as those of\nsource_file,\nmodified\n               by the file creation mask of the user if the\n-p\noption was\n               not specified. Otherwise, the permissions, owner ID, and\n               group ID of\ndest_file\nare implementation-defined.\n\n               If this creation fails for any reason,\ncp\nshall write a\n               diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more with\nsource_file\n, and go on to any remaining files.\n\n            c. If\nsource_file\nis a file of type symbolic link, and the\n               options require the symbolic link itself to be acted upon,\n               the pathname contained in\ndest_file\nshall be the same as\n               the pathname contained in\nsource_file\n.\n\n               If this fails for any reason,\ncp\nshall write a diagnostic\n               message to standard error, do nothing more with\nsource_file\n, and go on to any remaining files.\n\n       If the implementation provides additional or alternate access\n       control mechanisms (see the Base Definitions volume of\n       POSIX.1\u00e2\u0080\u00902017,\nSection 4.5\n,\nFile Access Permissions\n), their effect\n       on copies of files is implementation-defined.",

TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-'\n       takes effect only outside the POSIX locale.

With\n--color\n=\nauto\n, ls emits color codes\n       only when standard output is connected to a terminal.  The\n       LS_COLORS environment variable can change the settings.

If\n               a write error occurred in step 3d, it is unspecified if\ncp\ncontinues with any remaining files.

Otherwise, the permissions, owner ID, and\n               group ID of\ndest_file\nare implementation-defined.\n\n               If this creation fails for any reason,\ncp\nshall write a\n               diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more with\nsource_file\n, and go on to any remaining files.\n\n            c. If\nsource_file\nis a file of type symbolic link, and the\n               options require the symbolic link itself to be acted upon,\n               the pathname contained in\ndest_file\nshall be the same as\n               the pathname contained in\nsource_file\n.\n\n               If this fails for any reason,\ncp\nshall write a diagnostic\n               message to standard error, do nothing more with\nsource_file\n, and go on to any remaining files.\n\n       If the implementation provides additional or alternate access\n       control mechanisms (see the Base Definitions volume of\n       POSIX.1\u00e2\u0080\u00902017,\nSection 4.5\n,\nFile Access Permissions\n), their effect\n       on copies of files is implementation-defined.\n\n---\n\n",
