the concatenation of that\n           pathname, a <slash> character if that pathname did not end\n           with a <slash> character, and the\ndirectory\noperand names a\n           directory. if the pathname is null, test if the concatenation\n           of dot, a <slash> character, and the operand names a\n           directory. in either case, if the resulting string names an\n

 replacing three or more leading <slash> characters with a\n               single <slash>.  if, as a result of this canonicalization,\n               the\ncurpath\nvariable is null, no further steps

{path_max} bytes (including the terminating null), then\ncurpath\nshall be converted from an absolute pathname to an\n           equivalent relative pathname if possible. this conversion\n           shall always be considered possible if the value of\npwd\n, with\n           a trailing <slash> added if it does not already have one, is\n           an initial substring of\ncurpath\n.  whether or not it is\n           considered possible under other circumstances is unspecified.\n           implementations may also apply this conversion if\ncurpath\nis\n           not longer than {path_max} bytes or the\ndirectory\noperand was\n           longer than {path_max} bytes.\n\n       10. the\ncd\nutility shall then perform actions equivalent to the\nchdir\n() function called with\ncurpath\nas the\npath\nargument. if\n           these actions fail for any reason, the\ncd\nutility shall\n           display an appropriate error message and the remainder of this\n           step shall not be executed. if the\n-p\noption is not in effect,\n           the\npwd\nenvironment variable shall be set to the value that\ncurpath\nhad on entry to step 9 (i.e., before conversion to a\n           relative pathname). if the\n-p\noption is in effect, the\npwd\nenvironment variable shall be set to the string that would be\n           output by\npwd\n-p\n.  if there is insufficient permission on the\n           new directory, or on any parent of that directory, to\n           determine the current working directory, the value of the\npwd\nenvironment variable is unspecified.\n\n       if, during the execution of the above steps, the\npwd\nenvironment\n       variable is set, the\noldpwd\nenvironment variable shall also be set\n       to the value of the old working directory (that is the current\n       working directory immediately prior to the call to\ncd\n).\nRelevant sections:\n- \n\n---\n\nCommand: admin\nDescription: the\nadmin\nutility shall create new sccs files or change parameters\n       of existing ones. if a named file does not exist, it shall be\n       created, and its parameters shall be initialized according to the\n       specified options.  parameters not initialized by an option shall\n       be assigned a default value. if a named file does exist,\n       parameters corresponding to specified options shall be changed,\n       and other parameters shall be left as is.\n\n       all sccs filenames supplied by the application shall be of the\n       form s.\nfilename\n. new sccs files shall be given read-only\n       permission mode. write permission in the parent directory is\n       required to create a file. all writing done by\nadmin\nshall be to a\n       temporary\nx-file\n, named x.\nfilename\n(see\nget(1p)\n) created with\n       read-only mode if\nadmin\nis creating a new sccs file, or created\n       with the same mode as that of the sccs file if the file already\n       exists. after successful execution of\nadmin\n, the sccs file shall\n       be removed (if it exists), and the\nx-file\nshall be renamed with\n       the name of the sccs file. this ensures that changes are made to\n       the sccs file only if no errors occur.\n\n       the\nadmin\nutility shall also use a transient lock file (named\n       z.\nfilename\n), which is used to prevent simultaneous updates to the\n       sccs file;
