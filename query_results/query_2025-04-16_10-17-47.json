If the current\n           file is not a directory,\nrm\nshall perform actions equivalent\n           to the\nunlink\n() function defined in the System Interfaces\n           volume of POSIX.1\u00e2\u0080\u00902017 called with a pathname of the current\n           file used as the\npath\nargument.\n\n           If this fails for any reason,\nrm\nshall write a diagnostic\n           message to standard error, do nothing more with the current\n           file, and go on to any remaining files.\n\n       The\nrm\nutility shall be able to descend to arbitrary depths in a\n       file hierarchy, and shall not fail due to path length limitations\n       (unless an operand specified by the user exceeds system\n       limitations).\n\n---\n\nCommand: guards\nDescription: The script reads a configuration file that may contain so-called\n       guards, file names, and comments, and writes those file names that\n       satisfy all guards to standard output. The script takes a list of\n       symbols as its arguments. Each line in the configuration file is\n       processed separately. Lines may start with a number of guards. The\n       following guards are defined:\n\n           +\nxxx\nInclude the file(s) on this line if the symbol\nxxx\nis\n           defined.\n\n           -\nxxx\nExclude the file(s) on this line if the symbol\nxxx\nis\n           defined.\n\n           +!\nxxx\nInclude the file(s) on this line if the symbol\nxxx\nis\n           not defined.\n\n           -!\nxxx\nExclude the file(s) on this line if the symbol\nxxx\nis\n           not defined.\n\n           - Exclude this file. Used to avoid spurious\n--check\nmessages.\n\n       The guards are processed left to right. The last guard that\n       matches determines if the file is included. If no guard is\n       specified, the\n--default\nsetting determines if the file is\n       included.\n\n       If no configuration file is specified, the script reads from\n       standard input.\n\n       The\n--check\noption is used to compare the specification file\n       against the file system. If files are referenced in the\n       specification that do not exist, or if files are not enlisted in\n       the specification file warnings are printed. The\n--path\noption can\n       be used to specify which directory or directories to scan.\n       Multiple directories are separated by a colon (\":\") character. The\n--prefix\noption specifies the location of the files.\n       Alternatively, the\n--path=@<file>\nsyntax can be used to specify a\n       file from which the file names will be read.\n\n       Use\n--list\nto list all files independent of any rules. Use\n--invert-match\nto list only the excluded patches. Use\n--with-guards\nto also include all inclusion and exclusion rules.\nRelevant sections:\n- \n\n---\n\n",
  "response": "To find all files with a `.txt` extension in a directory, you can use the `find` command.\n\n*   **Command:** `find`\n*   **Description:** The `find` command searches for files in a directory hierarchy based on specified criteria.\n\n```bash\nfind <directory> -name \"*.txt\"\n```\n\n*   `<directory>`: The directory you want to search in. If omitted, it defaults to the current directory.\n*   `-name \"*.txt\"`: This option tells `find` to look for files whose names end with `.txt`. The `*` is a wildcard that matches any characters before `.txt`.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n1.  **Find `.txt` files in the current directory:**\n\n    ```bash\n    find . -name \"*.txt\"\n    ```\n    This command will search the current directory and all its subdirectories for files ending in `.txt`.\n\n2.  **Find `.txt` files in a specific directory:**\n\n    ```bash\n    find /path/to/your/directory -name \"*.txt\"\n    ```\n\n    Replace `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual path to the directory you want to search. This command searches the specified directory and its subdirectories.\n\n**Important Options:**\n\n*   `-type f`:  Add this option to only find files (and exclude directories).\n\n    ```bash\n    find . -type f -name \"*.txt\"\n    ```\n*   `-print`: While `find` usually prints the results to the standard output by default, you can explicitly use `-print` to ensure the filenames are printed.\n*   `-i`: if you want to find files case-insensitively, use `-iname` instead of `-name`.\n\n    ```bash\n    find . -iname \"*.TXT\"\n    ```\n",
