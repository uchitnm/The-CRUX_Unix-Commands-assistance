  "response": "Here's how you can find the top 10 most common mathematical function names defined in your Python files using `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, and `head`.\n\n**Commands:**\n\n*   **grep:**  This command searches for lines matching a pattern.\n*   **sort:** This command sorts the lines of a file.\n*   **uniq:** This command filters out repeated lines.  The `-c` option counts the number of times each unique line appears.\n*   **head:** This command displays the first few lines of a file. The `-n` option specifies the number of lines.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`grep`**:  Finds all lines in your Python files that define mathematical function names.  We'll use a regular expression to match common math functions.\n2.  **`sort`**: Sorts the lines found by `grep`.  This is necessary for `uniq -c` to count consecutive identical lines.\n3.  **`uniq -c`**: Counts the occurrences of each unique function name (after sorting).\n4.  **`sort -rn`**: Sorts the output numerically in reverse order, so the most frequent function names appear first.\n5.  **`head -n 10`**:  Takes the top 10 lines, giving you the 10 most common function names and their counts.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\ngrep -o -E '(sin|cos|tan|log|exp|sqrt|abs|pow)\\s*\\(' *.py | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -n 10\n```\n\nThis command does the following:\n\n*   `grep -o -E '(sin|cos|tan|log|exp|sqrt|abs|pow)\\s*\\(' *.py`: Searches all `.py` files for occurrences of `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, `exp`, `sqrt`, `abs`, or `pow` followed by whitespace and an opening parenthesis.  The `-o` option ensures that only the matched function name is printed, and `-E` enables extended regular expressions.\n*   `sort`: Sorts the matched function names alphabetically.\n*   `uniq -c`: Counts the occurrences of each unique function name.\n*   `sort -rn`: Sorts the output numerically ( `-n`) in reverse order (`-r`), so the most frequent names are at the top.\n*   `head -n 10`: Displays the top 10 most frequent function names.\n\n**Flags and Options:**\n\n*   **`grep -o`**:  Print only the matching part of the line.\n*   **`grep -E`**: Use extended regular expressions.\n*   **`sort -r`**: Sort in reverse order.\n*   **`sort -n`**: Sort numerically.\n*   **`uniq -c`**: Prefix each line in the output with the count of how many times it occurred.\n*   **`head -n`**: Output the first `n` lines.\n\n**Command Chaining:**\n\nThe example above is a command chain.  Here's another example that adds some flexibility:\n\n```bash\nfind . -name \"*.py\" -print0 | xargs -0 grep -o -E '(sin|cos|tan|log|exp|sqrt|abs|pow)\\s*\\(' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -n 10\n```\n\nThis chain does the following:\n\n*   `find . -name \"*.py\" -print0`: Finds all `.py` files in the current directory and its subdirectories.  `-print0` outputs the filenames separated by null characters, which handles filenames with spaces.\n*   `xargs -0 grep -o -E '(sin|cos|tan|log|exp|sqrt|abs|pow)\\s*\\('`:  Passes the filenames found by `find` to `grep`.  `xargs -0` reads the null-separated filenames correctly.  The rest of the command works as in the first example.\n\nThis second example is more robust, as it handles filenames with spaces and searches recursively through subdirectories. It also leverages `find` and `xargs` to handle an arbitrary number of files.\n",
