performance co-pilot (pcp), see\npcpintro(1)\n.  the metrics to\n       be reported are specified on the command line, in configuration\n       files, or both.  metrics can be automatically converted and scaled\n       using the pcp facilities, either by default or by per-metric\n       scaling specifications.  in addition to the existing metrics,\n       derived metrics can be defined using the arithmetic expressions\n       described in\npmregisterderived(3)\n.\n\n       a wide range of metricsets (see below) is included by default,\n       providing reports on per-process details, numa performance,\n       mimicking other tools like\nsar(1)\nand more, see the\npmrep\nconfiguration files in\n$pcp_sysconf_dir/pmrep\n(typically\n/etc/pcp/pmrep\n) for details.  tab completion for options, metrics,\n       and metricsets is available for bash and zsh.\n\n       unless directed to another host by the\n-h\noption,\npmrep\nwill\n       contact the performance metrics collector daemon (pmcd, see\npmcd(1)\n) on the local host.\n\n       the\n-a\noption causes\npmrep\nto use the specified set of archives\n       rather than connecting to a pmcd.  the\n-a\nand\n-h\noptions are\n       mutually exclusive.\n\n       the\n-l\noption causes\npmrep\nto use a local context to collect\n       metrics from dso pmdas (performance metrics domain agents,\n       ``plugins'') on the local host without pmcd.  only some metrics\n       are available in this mode.  the\n-a\n,\n-h\n, and\n-l\noptions are\n       mutually exclusive.\n\n       the metrics of interest are named in the\nmetricspec\nargument(s).\n       if a metricspec specifies a non-leaf node in the performance\n       metrics name space (pmns), then\npmrep\nwill recursively descend the\n       pmns and report on all leaf nodes (i.e. metrics) for that\n       metricspec.  use\npminfo(1)\nto list all the metrics (pmns lead\n       nodes) and their descriptions.\n\n       a\nmetricspec\nhas three different forms.  first, on the command\n       line it can start with a colon (``:'') to indicate a\nmetricset\nto\n       be read from\npmrep\nconfiguration files (see\n-c\nand\npmrep.conf(5)\n),\n       which may then consist of any number of metrics.  second, a\nmetricspec\nstarting with non-colon specifies a pmns node as\n       described above, optionally followed by metric output formatting\n       definitions.  this so-called\ncompact form\nof a metricspec is\n       defined as follows:\n\n     metric[,label[,instances[,unit/scale[,type[,width[,precision[,limit]]]]]]]\n\n       a valid pmns node (\nmetric\n) is mandatory.  it may be followed by a\n       text\nlabel\nused with\nstdout\noutput.  the optional\ninstances\ndefinition restricts\ncsv\nand\nstdout\nreporting to the specified\n       instances of the metric so non-matching instances will be filtered\n       out (see\n-i\n).  an optional\nunit/scale\nis applicable for dimension-\n       compatible, non-string metrics.  see below for supported\nunit/scale\nspecifications.  by default, cumulative counter metrics\n       are converted to rates, an optional\ntype\ncan be set to\nraw\nto\n       disable this rate conversion.  for\nstdout\noutput a numeric\nwidth\ncan be used to set the width of the output column for this metric.\n       too wide strings in the output will be truncated to fit the\n       column.  a metric-specific\nprecision\ncan be provided for numeric\n       non-integer output values.  lastly, a metric-specific\nlimit\ncan be\n       set for filtering out numeric values per the limit.\n\n       as a special case for metrics that are counters with time units\n       (nanoseconds to hours), the\nunit/scale\ncan be used to change the\n       default reporting (for example, milliseconds / second) to\n       normalize to the range zero to one by setting this to\nsec\n(see\n       also\n-y\nand\n-y\n).\n\n       the following\nmetricspec\nrequests the metric\nkernel.all.sysfork\nto\n       be reported under the text label\nforks\n, converting to the metric\n       default rate count/s in an\n8\nwide column.  although the\n       definitions in this\ncompact form\nare optional, they must always be\n       provided in the order specified above, thus the commas.\n\n               kernel.all.sysfork,forks,,,,8\n\n       the third form of a metricspec,\nverbose form\n, is described and\n       valid only in\npmrep.conf(5)\n.\n\n       derived metrics are specified like regular pmns leaf node metrics.\n\n       options via environment values (see\npmgetoptions(3)\n) override the\n       corresponding built-in default values (if any).  configuration\n       file options override the corresponding environment variables (if\n       any).  command line options override the

has\n       no member processes by bind mounting /proc/\npid\n/ns/\ntype\nfiles to a\n       filesystem path. a namespace that has been made persistent in this\n       way can subsequently be entered with\nnsenter(1)\neven after the\nprogram\nterminates (except pid namespaces where a permanently\n       running init process is required). once a persistent namespace is\n       no longer needed, it can be unpersisted by using\numount(8)\nto\n       remove the bind mount. see the\nexamples\nsection for more details.\nunshare\nsince util-linux version 2.36

performance metric, live or archived, system and/or\n       application, can be selected for reporting using one of the output\n       alternatives listed below together with applicable formatting\n       options.\npmrep\ncollects selected metric values through the facilities of\n       the performance co-pilot (pcp), see\npcpintro(1)\n.  the metrics to\n       be reported are specified on the command line, in configuration\n       files, or both.  metrics can be automatically converted and scaled\n       using the pcp facilities, either by default or by per-metric\n       scaling specifications.  in addition to the existing metrics,\n       derived metrics can be defined using the arithmetic expressions\n       described in\npmregisterderived(3)\n.\n\n       a wide range of metricsets (see below) is included by default,\n       providing reports on per-process details, numa performance,\n       mimicking other tools like\nsar(1)\nand more, see the\npmrep\nconfiguration files in\n$pcp_sysconf_dir/pmrep\n(typically\n/etc/pcp/pmrep\n) for details.  tab completion for options, metrics,\n       and metricsets is available for bash and zsh.\n\n       unless directed to another host by the\n-h\noption,\npmrep\nwill\n       contact the performance metrics collector daemon (pmcd, see\npmcd(1)\n) on the local host.\n\n       the\n-a\noption causes\npmrep\nto use the specified set of archives\n       rather than connecting to a pmcd.  the\n-a\nand\n-h\noptions are\n       mutually exclusive.\n\n       the\n-l\noption causes\npmrep\nto use a local context to collect\n       metrics from dso pmdas (performance metrics domain agents,\n       ``plugins'') on the local host without pmcd.  only some metrics\n       are available in this mode.  the\n-a\n,\n-h\n, and\n-l\noptions are\n       mutually exclusive.\n\n       the metrics of interest are named in the\nmetricspec\nargument(s).\n       if a metricspec specifies a non-leaf node in the performance\n       metrics name space (pmns), then\npmrep\nwill recursively descend the\n       pmns and report on all leaf nodes (i.e. metrics) for that\n       metricspec.  use\npminfo(1)\nto list all the metrics (pmns lead\n       nodes) and their descriptions.\n\n       a\nmetricspec\nhas three different forms.  first, on the command\n       line it can start with a colon (``:'') to indicate a\nmetricset\nto\n       be read from\npmrep\nconfiguration files (see\n-c\nand\npmrep.conf(5)\n),\n       which may then consist of any number of metrics.  second, a\nmetricspec\nstarting with non-colon specifies a pmns node as\n       described above, optionally followed by metric output formatting\n       definitions.  this so-called\ncompact form\nof a metricspec is\n       defined as follows:\n\n     metric[,label[,instances[,unit/scale[,type[,width[,precision[,limit]]]]]]]\n\n       a valid pmns node (\nmetric\n) is mandatory.  it may be followed by a\n       text\nlabel\nused with\nstdout\noutput.  the optional\ninstances\ndefinition restricts\ncsv\nand\nstdout\nreporting to the specified\n       instances of the metric so non-matching instances will be filtered\n       out (see\n-i\n).  an optional\nunit/scale\nis applicable for dimension-\n       compatible, non-string metrics.  see below for supported\nunit/scale\nspecifications.  by default, cumulative counter metrics\n       are converted to rates, an optional\ntype\ncan be set to\nraw\nto\n       disable this rate conversion.  for\nstdout\noutput a numeric\nwidth\ncan be used to set the width of the output column for this metric.\n       too wide strings in the output will be truncated to fit the\n       column.  a metric-specific\nprecision\ncan be provided for numeric\n       non-integer output values.  lastly, a metric-specific\nlimit\ncan be\n       set for filtering out numeric values per the limit.\n\n       as a special case for metrics that are counters with time units\n       (nanoseconds to hours), the\nunit/scale\ncan be used to change the\n       default reporting (for example, milliseconds / second) to\n       normalize to the range zero to one by setting this to\nsec\n(see\n       also\n-y\nand\n-y\n).\n\n       the following\nmetricspec\nrequests the metric\nkernel.all.sysfork\nto\n       be reported under the text label\nforks\n, converting to the metric\n       default rate count/s in an\n8\nwide column.  although the\n       definitions in this\ncompact form\nare optional, they must always be\n       provided in the order specified above, thus the commas.\n\n               kernel.all.sysfork,forks,,,,8\n\n       the third form of a metricspec,\nverbose form\n, is described and\n       valid only in\npmrep.conf(5)\n.\n\n       derived metrics are specified like regular pmns leaf node metrics.\n\n       options via environment values (see\npmgetoptions(3)\n) override the\n       corresponding built-in default values (if any).  configuration\n       file options override the corresponding environment variables (if\n       any).  command line options override the corresponding\n       configuration file options (if

This directly gives you the shell name without needing to know the directory structure.\n",
