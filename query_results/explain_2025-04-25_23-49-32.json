  "explanation": "### Command Overview\nThe `del` command (or `erase`) is used to delete one or more files from the specified location. It is an internal command of the Windows command interpreter.\n\n### Syntax\n```cmd\ndel [/p] [/f] [/s] [/q] [/a[:attributes]] [drive:][path]filename\nerase [/p] [/f] [/s] [/q] [/a[:attributes]] [drive:][path]filename\n```\n\n### Key Options\n- `/p`: Prompts for confirmation before deleting each file.\n- `/f`: Forces deletion of read-only files.\n- `/s`: Deletes specified files from all subdirectories.\n- `/q`: Quiet mode; does not prompt for confirmation.\n- `/a[:attributes]`: Deletes files with specified attributes. Attributes include:\n    * `r` Read-only files\n    * `h` Hidden files\n    * `s` System files\n    * `a` Files ready for archiving\n    * `i` Not content indexed files\n    * `l` Reparse points\n    * `-` Prefix meaning \"not\"\n\n### Examples\n```cmd\n# Example 1: Delete all .tmp files in the C:\\temp directory without prompting.\ndel /q C:\\temp\\*.tmp\n\n# Example 2: Delete all read-only .txt files in the current directory and all subdirectories, forcing deletion, and prompting for confirmation before each file.\ndel /s /f /p /a:r *.txt\n```\n\n### Notes\n*   The `del` command permanently deletes files.  Deleted files are not sent to the Recycle Bin from the command line. Exercise caution when using wildcards.\n*   Using `del *.*` in a directory will delete all files in that directory, but NOT the directory itself.\n*   `del` and `erase` are functionally equivalent in CMD.\n*   PowerShell uses the `Remove-Item` cmdlet for file deletion, which offers similar, but not identical, functionality (and by default places deleted files in the recycle bin).\n*   The `/q` option overrides the `Prompt for confirmation` option in Windows Explorer Folder Options."
