  "response": "Here's how to find users who have logged in more than 5 times:\n\n**Commands:**\n\n*   `last`:  Displays a listing of the last logged in users.  It reads from `/var/log/wtmp` by default, or a specified file.\n*   `awk`: A powerful text processing tool.\n*   `sort`: Sorts the output.\n*   `uniq -c`: Reports the number of times each unique line appears.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis solution uses `last` to get login records, then `awk` to extract usernames.  `sort` and `uniq -c` count login occurrences for each user.  Finally, `awk` filters the list to show only those users with more than 5 logins.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\nlast | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '$1 > 5 {print $2}'\n```\n\n*   This pipeline first gets login records with `last`. The first `awk` command extracts the username (first field). Then, the usernames are sorted, and `uniq -c` counts how many times each user appears. The second `awk` command filters and prints usernames with a count greater than 5.\n\n```bash\nlast | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '$1>5 {print $2, $1}'\n```\n\n*   This example displays both the username and the login count for users who have logged in more than 5 times.\n",
