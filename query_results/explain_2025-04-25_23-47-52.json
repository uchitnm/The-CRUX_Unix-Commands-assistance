  "explanation": "### Command Overview\nThe `del` command deletes one or more files. It is a core command-line utility for removing files from the file system. It can handle wildcards for batch deletion.\n\n### Syntax\n```cmd\ndel [/p] [/f] [/s] [/q] [/a[:attributes]] [filenames]\n```\n\n### Key Options\n- `/p`: Prompts for confirmation before deleting each file.\n- `/f`: Forces deletion of read-only files.\n- `/s`: Deletes specified files from all subdirectories.\n- `/q`: Quiet mode, do not ask if ok to delete on global wildcard.\n- `/a[:attributes]`: Deletes files with specified attributes. Attributes include:\n    - `r` Read-only files\n    - `h` Hidden files\n    - `a` Files ready for archiving\n    - `s` System files\n    - `i` Not content indexed files\n    - `l` Reparse Points\n    - `-` Prefix meaning \"not\"\n\n### Examples\n```cmd\n# Example 1: Delete all .tmp files in C:\\temp without confirmation\ndel C:\\temp\\*.tmp /q\n\n# Example 2: Delete all .log files in C:\\logs and all subdirectories, forcing deletion of read-only files, and prompting for confirmation for each file.\ndel /s /f /p C:\\logs\\*.log\n```\n\n### Notes\n*   The `del` command permanently deletes files. Be cautious when using wildcards.  Recovering deleted files through the command line typically requires using third-party tools.\n*   The `del` command is available in both Command Prompt (CMD) and PowerShell in Windows. While PowerShell has its own `Remove-Item` cmdlet which is preferred, `del` is usually aliased to `Remove-Item` for backwards compatibility.  PowerShell offers additional functionality for more advanced file management tasks.\n*   Using `/q` (Quiet mode) together with wildcards can be dangerous if you are not sure which files will be deleted. Always double-check the target path before executing the command.\n*   Administrator privileges may be required to delete files in certain protected directories."
