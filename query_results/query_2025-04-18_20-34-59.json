  "response": "```markdown\nTo list all installed packages with their version numbers on a Debian-based system, you can use the `dpkg-query` command.\n\n**Command:** `dpkg-query`\n\n**Explanation:**\n`dpkg-query` is a tool for querying the dpkg database. The `-W` option is used to display package information, and you can customize the output format using the `-f` option.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```bash\ndpkg-query -W -f='${Package} ${Version}\\n'\n```\n\nThis command directly outputs the package name and version number for each installed package, separated by a space and each on a new line.  It's the most concise and efficient way to get the desired information. There is no need for any further commands or pipelines.\n",
