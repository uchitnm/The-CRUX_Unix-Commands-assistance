[mariadbd\nn\n] groups can be\n       used for options passed to specific\nmariadbd\ninstances.\n\n       the [mariadbd] or [mariadbd_safe] groups can be used for common\n       options read by all instances of\nmariadbd\nor\nmariadbd_safe\n. you\n       can specify a\n--defaults-file=\nfile_name\noption to use a different\n       configuration file for that instance, in which case the [mariadbd]\n       or [mariadbd_safe] groups from that file will be used for that\n       instance.\nmariadbd-multi\nsupports the following options.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--help\ndisplay a help message and exit.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--example\ndisplay a sample option file.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--log=\nfile_name\nspecify the name of the log file. if the file exists, log\n           output is appended to it.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--mariadb-admin=\nprog_name\nthe\nmariadb-admin\nbinary to be used to stop servers.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--mariadbd=\nprog_name\nthe\nmariadbd\nbinary to be used. note that you can specify\nmariadbd_safe\nas the value for this option also. if you use\nmariadbd_safe\nto start the server, you can include the\n           mariadbd or ledir options in the corresponding [mariadbd\nn\n]\n           option group. these options indicate the name of the server\n           that\nmariadbd_safe\nshould start and the path name of the\n           directory where the server is located. (see the descriptions\n           for these options in\nmariadbd_safe\n(1).) example:\n\n               [mariadbd38]\n               mariadbd = mariadbd-debug\n               ledir  = /opt/local/mysql/libexec\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--no-log\nprint log information to stdout rather than to the log file.\n           by default, output goes to the log file.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--password=\npassword\nthe password of the mariadb account to use when invoking\nmariadb-admin\n. note that the password value is not optional\n           for this option, unlike for other mariadb programs.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--silent\nsilent mode; disable warnings.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--tcp-ip\nconnect to the mariadb server(s) via the tcp/ip port instead\n           of the unix socket. this affects stopping and reporting. if a\n           socket file is missing, the server may still be running, but\n           can be accessed only via the tcp/ip port. by default\n           connecting is done via the unix socket. this option affects\n           stop and report operations.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--user=\nuser_name\nthe user name of the mariadb account to use when invoking\nmariadb-admin\n.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--verbose\nbe more verbose.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--version\ndisplay version information and exit.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--wsrep-new-cluster\nbootstrap a cluster.\n\n       some notes about\nmariadbd-multi\n:\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nmost important\n: before using\nmariadbd-multi\nbe sure that you\n           understand the meanings of the options that are passed to the\nmariadbd\nservers and\nwhy\nyou would want to have separate\nmariadbd\nprocesses. beware of the dangers of using multiple\nmariadbd\nservers with the same data directory. use separate\n           data directories, unless you\nknow\nwhat you are doing. starting\n           multiple servers with the same data directory does\nnot\ngive\n           you extra performance in a threaded system.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nimportant\n: make sure that the data directory for each server\n           is fully accessible to the unix account that the specific\nmariadbd\nprocess is started as.\ndo not\nuse the unix\nroot\naccount for this, unless you\nknow\nwhat you are doing.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2   make sure that the mariadb account used for stopping the\nmariadbd\nservers (with the\nmariadbadmin\nprogram) has the same\n           user name and password for each server. also, make sure that\n           the account has the shutdown privilege. if the servers that\n           you want to manage have different user names or passwords for\n           the administrative accounts, you might want to create an\n           account on each server that has the same user name and\n           password. for example, you might set up a common multi_admin\n           account by executing the following commands for each server:\n\n               shell>\nmariadb -u root -s /tmp/mariadb.sock -p\nenter password:\n               mariadb>\ngrant shutdown on *.*\n->\nto 'multi_admin'@'localhost' identified by 'multipass';\nchange the connection parameters appropriately when connecting\n           to each one. note that the host name part of the account name\n           must allow you to connect as multi_admin from the host where\n           you want to run\nmariadbd-multi\n.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2   the unix socket file and the tcp/ip port number must be\n           different for every\nmariadbd\n. (alternatively, if the host has\n           multiple network addresses, you can use\n--bind-address\nto\n           cause different servers to listen to different interfaces.)\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2   the\n--pid-file\noption is very important if you are using\nmariadbd-safe\nto start\nmariadbd\n(for example,\n--mariadbd=mariadbd-safe\n) every\nmariadbd\nshould have its own\n           process id file. the advantage of using\nmariadbd-safe\ninstead\n           of\nmariadbd\nis that\nmariadbd-safe\nmonitors its\nmariadbd\nprocess and restarts it if the process terminates due to a\n           signal sent using kill -9 or for other reasons, such as a\n           segmentation fault. please note that the\nmariadbd-safe\nscript\n           might require that you start it from a certain place. this\n           means that you might have to change location to a certain\n           directory before running\nmariadbd-multi\n. if you have problems\n           starting, please see the\nmariadbd-safe\nscript. check\n           especially the lines:\n\n               ----------------------------------------------------------------\n               my_pwd=`pwd`\n               # check if we are starting this relative (for the binary release)\n               if test -d $my_pwd/data/mariadb -a \\\n                  -f ./share/mariadb/english/errmsg.sys -a \\\n                  -x ./bin/mariadbd\n               ----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n           the test performed by these lines should be successful, or you\n           might encounter problems. see\nmariadbd-safe(1)\n.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2   you might want to use the\n--user\noption for\nmariadbd\n, but to\n           do this you need to run the\nmariadbd-multi\nscript as the unix\n           root user. having the option in the option file doesn't\n           matter; you just get a warning if you are not the superuser\n           and the\nmariadbd\nprocesses are started under your own unix\n           account.\n\n       the following example shows how you might set up an option file\n       for use with\nmariadbd-multi\n. the order in which the\nmariadbd\nprograms are started or stopped depends on the order in which they\n       appear in the option file. group numbers need not form an unbroken\n       sequence. the first and fifth [mariadbd\nn\n] groups were\n       intentionally omitted from the example to illustrate that you can\n       have \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaps\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the option file. this gives you more flexibility.\n\n           # this file should probably be in your home dir (~/.my.cnf)\n           # or /etc/my.cnf\n           # version 2.1 by jani tolonen\n           [mariadbd-multi]\n           mariadbd     = /usr/local/bin/mariadbd-safe\n           mariadb-admin = /usr/local/bin/mariadb-admin\n           user       = multi_admin\n           password   = multipass\n           [mariadbd2]\n           socket     = /tmp/mariadb.sock2\n           port       = 3307\n           pid-file   = /usr/local/mysql/var2/hostname.pid2\n           datadir    = /usr/local/mysql/var2\n           language   = /usr/local/share/mariadb/english\n           user       = john\n           [mariadbd3]\n           socket     = /tmp/mysql.sock3\n           port       = 3308\n           pid-file   = /usr/local/mysql/var3/hostname.pid3\n           datadir    = /usr/local/mysql/var3\n           language   = /usr/local/share/mariadb/swedish\n           user       = monty\n           [mariadbd4]\n           socket     = /tmp/mysql.sock4\n           port       = 3309\n           pid-file   = /usr/local/mysql/var4/hostname.pid4\n           datadir    = /usr/local/mysql/var4\n           language   = /usr/local/share/mariadb/estonia\n           user       = tonu\n           [mariadbd6]\n           socket     = /tmp/mysql.sock6\n           port       = 3311\n           pid-file   = /usr/local/mysql/var6/hostname.pid6\n           datadir    = /usr/local/mysql/var6\n           language   = /usr/local/share/mariadb/japanese\n           user       = jani",

(alternatively, if the host has\n           multiple network addresses, you can use\n--bind-address\nto\n           cause different servers to listen to different interfaces.)\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2   the\n--pid-file\noption is very important if you are using\nmariadbd-safe\nto start\nmariadbd\n(for example,\n--mariadbd=mariadbd-safe\n) every\nmariadbd\nshould have its own\n           process id file. the advantage of using\nmariadbd-safe\ninstead\n           of\nmariadbd\nis that\nmariadbd-safe\nmonitors its\nmariadbd\nprocess and restarts it if the process terminates due to a\n           signal sent using kill -9 or for other reasons, such as a\n           segmentation fault. please note that the\nmariadbd-safe\nscript\n           might require that you start it from a certain place. this\n           means that you might have to change location to a certain\n           directory before running\nmariadbd-multi\n. if you have problems\n           starting, please see the\nmariadbd-safe\nscript. check\n           especially the lines:\n\n               ----------------------------------------------------------------\n               my_pwd=`pwd`\n               # check if we are starting this relative (for the binary release)\n               if test -d $my_pwd/data/mariadb -a \\\n                  -f ./share/mariadb/english/errmsg.sys -a \\\n                  -x ./bin/mariadbd\n               ----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n           the test performed by these lines should be successful, or you\n           might encounter problems. see\nmariadbd-safe(1)\n.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2   you might want to use the\n--user\noption for\nmariadbd\n, but to\n           do this you need to run the\nmariadbd-multi\nscript as the unix\n           root user. having the option in the option file doesn't\n           matter; you just get a warning if you are not the superuser\n           and the\nmariadbd\nprocesses are started under your own unix\n           account.\n\n       the following example shows how you might set up an option file\n       for use with\nmariadbd-multi\n. the order in which the\nmariadbd\nprograms are started or stopped depends on the order in which they\n       appear in the option file. group numbers need not form an unbroken\n       sequence. the first and fifth [mariadbd\nn\n] groups were\n       intentionally omitted from the example to illustrate that you can\n       have \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaps\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the option file. this gives you more flexibility.\n\n           # this file should probably be in your home dir (~/.my.cnf)\n           # or /etc/my.cnf\n           # version 2.1 by jani tolonen\n           [mariadbd-multi]\n

\n\n---\n\nCommand: pcp-atopsar\nDescription: the\npcp-atopsar\nprogram can be used to report statistics at the\n       system level.\n\n       in the first synopsis line (no sampling interval specified),\npcp-\natopsar\nextracts data from a raw logfile that has been recorded\n       previously by\npmlogger(1)\n(or via the\n-w\noption of the\npcp-atop\nprogram).\n       you can specify the name of the logfile with the\n-r\noption of the\npcp-atopsar\nprogram.  when a\npmlogger\ndaily logfile is used, named\n$pcp_log_dir/pmlogger/[host]/yyyymmdd\n(where yyyymmdd reflects the\n       date), the required date of the form yyyymmdd can be specified\n       with the\n-r\noption instead of the filename, or the symbolic name\n       'y' can be used for yesterday's daily logfile (this can be\n       repeated so 'yyyy' indicates the logfile of four days ago).  if\n       the\n-r\noption is not specified at all, today's daily logfile is\n       used by default.\n       by default, the hostname of the localhost will be used when\n       resolving\npmlogger\narchives, however an alternative\nhost\ncan be\n       specified using the\n-h\noption.\n       the starting and ending times of the report can be defined using\n       the options\n-b\nand\n-e\nfollowed by a time argument of the form\n       [yyyymmdd]hh:mm[ss].\n\n       in the second synopsis line,\npcp-atopsar\nreads actual activity\n       counters from the kernel with the specified\ninterval\n(in seconds)\n       and the specified number of\nsamples\n(optionally).  when\npcp-\natopsar\nis activated in this way it immediately sends the output\n       for every requested report to standard output.  if only one type\n       of report is requested, the header is printed once and after every\ninterval\nseconds the statistical counters are shown for that\n       period.  if several reports are requested, a header is printed per\n       sample followed by the statistical counters for that period.\n\n       when invoked via the\npcp(1)\ncommand,

  "response": "Here's how to count the number of lines in all `.log` files in the current directory using the most efficient UNIX command:\n\n**Command:** `wc` (word count)\n\n**Explanation:** The `wc` command, with the `-l` option, counts the number of lines in a file. When given multiple files, it prints the count for each file and a total.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```bash\nwc -l *.log\n```\n\nThis single command accomplishes the task in the most concise way possible.  It directly counts the lines in all files ending with `.log` in the current directory and provides a total count. There is no better way to complete this action than `wc -l *.log` due to the commands simple nature to count all lines and provide a complete sum.\n",
