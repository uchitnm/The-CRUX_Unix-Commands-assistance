Both programs are run as\n       part of the test suite.\n\n       The source code for the programs can be found in in tests/mariadb-\n       client-test.c in a source distribution. The program serves as a\n       good source of examples illustrating how to use various features\n       of the client API.\nmariadb-client-test\nis used in a test by the same name in the main\n       tests suite of\nmariadb-test-run.pl\nbut may also be run directly.\n       Unlike the other programs listed here, it does not read an\n       external description of what tests to run. Instead, all tests are\n       coded into the program, which is written to cover all aspects of\n       the C language API.\nmariadb-client-test\nsupports the following options:\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--help\n,\n-?\nDisplay a help message and exit.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--basedir=\ndir_name\n,\n-b\ndir_name\nThe base directory for the tests.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--count=\ncount\n,\n-t\ncount\nThe number of times to execute the tests.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--database=\ndb_name\n,\n-D\ndb_name\nThe database to use.\n\n       \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\n--debug[=\ndebug_options\n]\n,\n-#[\ndebug_options\n]\nWrite a debugging log if MariaDB is built with debugging\n           support.
