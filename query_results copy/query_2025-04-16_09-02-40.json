      "description": "dash\nis the standard command interpreter for the system.  The\n       current version of\ndash\nis in the process of being changed to\n       conform with the POSIX 1003.2 and 1003.2a specifications for the\n       shell.  This version has many features which make it appear\n       similar in some respects to the Korn shell, but it is not a Korn\n       shell clone (see\nksh\n(1)).  Only features designated by POSIX, plus\n       a few Berkeley extensions, are being incorporated into this shell.\n       This man page is not intended to be a tutorial or a complete\n       specification of the shell.\nOverview\nThe shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the\n       terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.\n       It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system\n       (although a user can select a different shell with the\nchsh\n(1)\n       command).  The shell implements a language that has flow control\n       constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features\n       in addition to data storage, along with built in history and line\n       editing capabilities.  It incorporates many features to aid\n       interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative\n       language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use\n       (shell scripts).  That is, commands can be typed directly to the\n       running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be\n       executed directly by the shell.\nInvocation\nIf no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is\n       connected to a terminal (or if the\n-i\nflag is set), and the\n-c\noption is not present, the shell is considered an interactive\n       shell.  An interactive shell generally prompts before each command\n       and handles programming and command errors differently (as\n       described below).  When first starting, the shell inspects\n       argument 0, and if it begins with a dash \u00e2\u0080\u0098-\u00e2\u0080\u0099, the shell is also\n       considered a login shell.  This is normally done automatically by\n       the system when the user first logs in.  A login shell first reads\n       commands from the files\n/etc/profile\nand\n.profile\nif they exist.\n       If the environment variable ENV is set on entry to an interactive\n       shell, or is set in the\n.profile\nof a login shell, the shell next\n       reads commands from the file named in ENV.  Therefore, a user\n       should place commands that are to be executed only at login time\n       in the\n.profile\nfile, and commands that are executed for every\n       interactive shell inside the ENV file.  To set the ENV variable to\n       some file, place the following line in your\n.profile\nof your home\n       directory\nENV=$HOME/.shinit; export ENV\nsubstituting for \u00e2\u0080\u009c.shinit\u00e2\u0080\u009d any filename you wish.\n\n       If command line arguments besides the options have been specified,\n       then the shell treats the first argument as the name of a file\n       from which to read commands (a shell script), and the remaining\n       arguments are set as the positional parameters of the shell ($1,\n       $2, etc).  Otherwise, the shell reads commands from its standard\n       input.\nArgument List Processing\nAll of the single letter options that have a corresponding name\n       can be used as an argument to the\n-o\noption.  The set\n-o\nname is\n       provided next to the single letter option in the description\n       below.  Specifying a dash \u00e2\u0080\u009c-\u00e2\u0080\u009d turns the option on, while using a\n       plus \u00e2\u0080\u009c+\u00e2\u0080\u009d disables the option.  The following options can be set\n       from the command line or with the\nset\nbuiltin (described later).\n-a\nallexport\nExport all variables assigned to.\n-c\nRead commands from the\ncommand_string\noperand instead of from the standard input.\n                              Special parameter 0 will be set from the\ncommand_name\noperand and the positional\n                              parameters ($1, $2, etc.)  set from the\n                              remaining argument operands.\n-C\nnoclobber\nDon't overwrite existing files with \u00e2\u0080\u009c>\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n-e\nerrexit\nIf not interactive, exit immediately if any\n                              untested command fails.  The exit status of\n                              a command is considered to be explicitly\n                              tested if the command is used to control an\nif\n,\nelif\n,\nwhile\n, or\nuntil\n; or if the\n                              command is the left hand operand of an \u00e2\u0080\u009c&&\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n                              or \u00e2\u0080\u009c||\u00e2\u0080\u009d operator.\n-f\nnoglob\nDisable pathname expansion.\n-n\nnoexec\nIf not interactive, read commands but do\n                              not execute them.

This option has no effect when\n                              set after the shell has already started\n                              running (i.e. with\nset\n).\n-V\nvi\nEnable the built-in\nvi\n(1) command line\n                              editor (disables\n-E\nif it has been set).\n-E\nemacs\nEnable the built-in\nemacs\n(1) command line\n                              editor (disables\n-V\nif it has been set).\n-b\nnotify\nEnable asynchronous notification of\n                              background job completion.  (UNIMPLEMENTED\n                              for 4.4alpha)\nLexical Structure\nThe shell reads input in terms of lines from a file and breaks it\n       up into words at whitespace (blanks and tabs), and at certain\n       sequences of characters that are special to the shell called\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009coperators\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  There are two types of operators: control operators\n       and redirection operators (their meaning is discussed later).\n       Following is a list of operators:\n\n             Control operators:\n& && ( ) ; ;;\n|\n|| <newline>\nRedirection operators:\n< > >| << >> <& >& <<- <>\nQuoting\nQuoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain\n       characters or words to the shell, such as operators, whitespace,\n       or keywords.  There are three types of quoting: matched single\n       quotes, matched double quotes, and backslash.\nBackslash\nA backslash preserves the literal meaning of the following\n       character, with the exception of \u00e2\u009f\u00a8newline\u00e2\u009f\u00a9.  A backslash preceding\n       a \u00e2\u009f\u00a8newline\u00e2\u009f\u00a9 is treated as a line continuation.\nSingle Quotes\nEnclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal\n       meaning of all the characters (except single quotes, making it\n       impossible to put single-quotes in a single-quoted string).\nDouble Quotes\nEnclosing characters within double quotes preserves the literal\n       meaning of all characters except dollarsign ($), backquote (`),\n       and backslash (\\).  The backslash inside double quotes is\n       historically weird, and serves to quote only the following\n       characters:\n$ ` \" \\ <newline>\n.\n       Otherwise it remains literal.\nReserved Words\nReserved words are words that have special meaning to the shell\n       and are recognized at the beginning of a line and after a control\n       operator.  The following are reserved words:\n\n             !       elif    fi      while   case\n             else    for     then    {       }\n             do      done    until   if      esac\n\n       Their meaning is discussed later.\nAliases\nAn alias is a name and corresponding value set using the\nalias\n(1)\n       builtin command.  Whenever a reserved word may occur (see above),\n       and after checking for reserved words, the shell checks the word\n       to see if it matches an alias.  If it does, it replaces it in the\n       input stream with its value.  For example, if there is an alias\n       called \u00e2\u0080\u009clf\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the value \u00e2\u0080\u009cls -F\u00e2\u0080\u009d, then the input:\nlf foobar\n\u00e2\u009f\u00a8return\u00e2\u009f\u00a9\n\n       would become\nls -F foobar\n\u00e2\u009f\u00a8return\u00e2\u009f\u00a9\n\n       Aliases provide a convenient way for naive users to create\n       shorthands for commands without having to learn how to create\n       functions with arguments.  They can also be used to create\n       lexically obscure code.  This use is discouraged.\nCommands\nThe shell interprets the words it reads according to a language,\n       the specification of which is outside the scope of this man page\n       (refer to the BNF in the POSIX 1003.2 document).  Essentially\n       though, a line is read and if the first word of the line (or after\n       a control operator) is not a reserved word, then the shell has\n       recognized a simple command.  Otherwise, a complex command or some\n       other special construct may have been recognized.\nSimple Commands\nIf a simple command has been recognized, the shell performs the\n       following actions:\n\n             1.   Leading words of the form \u00e2\u0080\u009cname=value\u00e2\u0080\u009d are stripped off\n                  and assigned to the environment of the simple command.\n                  Redirection operators and their arguments (as described\n                  below) are stripped off and saved for processing.\n\n             2.   The remaining words are expanded as described in the\n                  section called \u00e2\u0080\u009cExpansions\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and the first remaining\n                  word is considered the command name and the command is\n                  located.  The remaining words are considered the\n                  arguments of the command.  If no command name resulted,\n                  then the \u00e2\u0080\u009cname=value\u00e2\u0080\u009d variable assignments recognized\n                  in item 1 affect the current shell.\n\n             3.   Redirections are performed as described in the next\n                  section.\nRedirections\nRedirections are used to change where a command reads its input or\n       sends its output.  In general, redirections open, close, or\n       duplicate an existing reference to a file.  The overall format\n       used for redirection is:\n[n]\nredir-op file\nwhere\nredir-op\nis one of the redirection operators mentioned\n       previously.  Following is a list of the possible redirections.\n       The [n] is an optional number between 0 and 9, as in \u00e2\u0080\u00983\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (not\n       \u00e2\u0080\u0098[3]\u00e2\u0080\u0099), that refers to a file descriptor.\n\n             [n]> file   Redirect standard output (or n) to file.\n\n             [n]>| file  Same, but override the\n-C\noption.\n\n             [n]>> file  Append standard output (or n) to file.\n\n             [n]< file   Redirect standard input (or n) from file.\n\n             [n1]<&n2    Copy file descriptor n2 as stdin (or fd n1).\n\n             [n]<&-      Close standard input (or n).\n\n             [n1]>&n2    Copy file descriptor n2 as stdout (or fd n1).\n\n             [n]>&-      Close standard output (or n).\n\n             [n]<> file  Open file for reading and writing on standard\n                         input (or n).\n\n       The following redirection is often called a \u00e2\u0080\u009chere-document\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n[n]<< delimiter\nhere-doc-text ...\ndelimiter\nAll the text on successive lines up to the delimiter is saved away\n       and made available to the command on standard input, or file\n       descriptor n if it is specified.  If the delimiter as specified on\n       the initial line is quoted, then the here-doc-text is treated\n       literally, otherwise the text is subjected to parameter expansion,\n       command substitution, and arithmetic expansion (as described in\n       the section on \u00e2\u0080\u009cExpansions\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  If the operator is \u00e2\u0080\u009c<<-\u00e2\u0080\u009d instead of\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009c<<\u00e2\u0080\u009d, then leading tabs in the here-doc-text are stripped.\nSearch and Execution\nThere are three types of commands: shell functions, builtin\n       commands, and normal programs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the command is searched for\n       (by name) in that order.  They each are executed in a different\n       way.\n\n       When a shell function is executed, all of the shell positional\n       parameters (except $0, which remains unchanged) are set to the\n       arguments of the shell function.  The variables which are\n       explicitly placed in the environment of the command (by placing\n       assignments to them before the function name) are made local to\n       the function and are set to the values given.  Then the command\n       given in the function definition is executed.  The positional\n       parameters are restored to their original values when the command\n       completes.  This all occurs within the current shell.\n\n       Shell builtins are executed internally to the shell, without\n       spawning a new process.\n\n       Otherwise, if the command name doesn't match a function or\n       builtin, the command is searched for as a normal program in the\n       file system (as described in the next section).  When a normal\n       program is executed, the shell runs the program, passing the\n       arguments and the environment to the program.  If the program is\n       not a normal executable file (i.e., if it does not begin with the\n       \"magic number\" whose ASCII representation is \"#!\", so\nexecve\n(2)\n       returns ENOEXEC then) the shell will interpret the program in a\n       subshell.  The child shell will reinitialize itself in this case,\n       so that the effect will be as if a new shell had been invoked to\n       handle the ad-hoc shell script, except that the location of hashed\n       commands located in the parent shell will be remembered by the\n       child.\n\n       Note that previous versions of this document and the source code\n       itself misleadingly and sporadically refer to a shell script\n       without a magic number as a \"shell procedure\".\nPath Search\nWhen locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a\n       shell function by that name.  Then it looks for a builtin command\n       by that name.  If a builtin command is not found, one of two\n       things happen:\n\n       1.   Command names containing a slash are simply executed without\n            performing any searches.\n\n       2.   The shell searches each entry in PATH in turn for the\n            command.  The value of the PATH variable should be a series\n            of entries separated by colons.  Each entry consists of a\n            directory name.  The current directory may be indicated\n            implicitly by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a\n            single period.\nCommand Exit Status\nEach command has an exit status that can influence the behaviour\n       of other shell commands.  The paradigm is that a command exits\n       with zero for normal or success, and non-zero for failure, error,\n       or a false indication.  The man page for each command should\n       indicate the various exit codes and what they mean.  Additionally,\n       the builtin commands return exit codes, as does an executed shell\n       function.\n\n       If a command consists entirely of variable assignments then the\n       exit status of the command is that of the last command\n       substitution if any, otherwise 0.\nComplex Commands\nComplex commands are combinations of simple commands with control\n       operators or reserved words, together creating a larger complex\n       command.  More generally, a command is one of the following:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nsimple command\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\npipeline\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nlist or compound-list\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\ncompound command\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nfunction definition\n\n       Unless otherwise stated, the exit status of a command is that of\n       the last simple command executed by the command.\nPipelines\nA pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the\n       control operator |.  The standard output of all but the last\n       command is connected to the standard input of the next command.\n       The standard output of the last command is inherited from the\n       shell, as usual.\n\n       The format for a pipeline is:\n[!] command1\n[|\ncommand2 ...]\nThe standard output of command1 is connected to the standard input\n       of command2.  The standard input, standard output, or both of a\n       command is considered to be assigned by the pipeline before any\n       redirection specified by redirection operators that are part of\n       the command.\n\n       If the pipeline is not in the background (discussed later), the\n       shell waits for all commands to complete.\n\n       If the\npipefail\noption was enabled when the shell began execution\n       of the pipeline, the pipeline's exit status is the exit status of\n       the last command specified in the pipeline that exited with non-\n       zero status, or zero if all commands in the pipeline exited with a\n       status of zero. If the\npipefail\noption was not enabled, the\n       pipeline's exit status is the exit status of the last command\n       specified in the pipeline; the exit statuses of any other commands\n       are not used. If the reserved word ! precedes the pipeline, its\n       exit status is the logical NOT of the exit status described above.\n\n       Because pipeline assignment of standard input or standard output\n       or both takes place before redirection, it can be modified by\n       redirection.  For example:\n$ command1 2>&1\n|\ncommand2\nsends both the standard output and standard error of command1 to\n       the standard input of command2.\n\n       A ; or \u00e2\u009f\u00a8newline\u00e2\u009f\u00a9 terminator causes the preceding AND-OR-list\n       (described next) to be executed sequentially; a & causes\n       asynchronous execution of the preceding AND-OR-list.\n\n       Note that unlike some other shells, each process in the pipeline\n       is a child of the invoking shell (unless it is a shell builtin, in\n       which case it executes in the current shell \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but any effect it\n       has on the environment is wiped).\nBackground Commands \u00e2\u0080\u0093 &\nIf a command is terminated by the control operator ampersand (&),\n       the shell executes the command asynchronously \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is, the shell\n       does not wait for the command to finish before executing the next\n       command.\n\n       The format for running a command in background is:\ncommand1 & [command2 & ...]\nIf the shell is not interactive, the standard input of an\n       asynchronous command is set to\n/dev/null\n.\nLists \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Generally Speaking\nA list is a sequence of zero or more commands separated by\n       newlines, semicolons, or ampersands, and optionally terminated by\n       one of these three characters.  The commands in a list are\n       executed in the order they are written.  If command is followed by\n       an ampersand, the shell starts the command and immediately\n       proceeds onto the next command; otherwise it waits for the command\n       to terminate before proceeding to the next one.\nShort-Circuit List Operators\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c&&\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009c||\u00e2\u0080\u009d are AND-OR list operators.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c&&\u00e2\u0080\u009d executes the first\n       command, and then executes the second command if and only if the\n       exit status of the first command is zero.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c||\u00e2\u0080\u009d is similar, but\n       executes the second command if and only if the exit status of the\n       first command is nonzero.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c&&\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009c||\u00e2\u0080\u009d both have the same\n       priority.\nFlow-Control Constructs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if, while, for, case\nThe syntax of the if command is\n\n             if list\n             then list\n             [ elif list\n             then    list ] ...\n             [ else list ]\n             fi\n\n       The syntax of the while command is\n\n             while list\n             do   list\n             done\n\n       The two lists are executed repeatedly while the exit status of the\n       first list is zero.  The until command is similar, but has the\n       word until in place of while, which causes it to repeat until the\n       exit status of the first list is zero.\n\n       The syntax of the for command is\n\n             for variable [ in [ word ... ] ]\n             do   list\n             done\n\n       The words following\nin\nare expanded, and then the list is executed\n       repeatedly with the variable set to each word in turn.  Omitting\n       in word ... is equivalent to in \"$@\".\n\n       The syntax of the break and continue command is\n\n             break [ num ]\n             continue [ num ]\n\n       Break terminates the num innermost for or while loops.  Continue\n       continues with the next iteration of the innermost loop.  These\n       are implemented as builtin commands.\n\n       The syntax of the case command is\n\n             case word in\n             [(]pattern) list ;;\n             ...\n             esac\n\n       The pattern can actually be one or more patterns (see \u00e2\u0080\u009cShell\n       Patterns\u00e2\u0080\u009d described later), separated by \u00e2\u0080\u009c|\u00e2\u0080\u009d characters.  The \u00e2\u0080\u009c(\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n       character before the pattern is optional.\nGrouping Commands Together\nCommands may be grouped by writing either\n(list)\nor\n{ list; }\nThe first of these executes the commands in a subshell.  Builtin\n       commands grouped into a (list) will not affect the current shell.\n       The second form does not fork another shell so is slightly more\n       efficient.  Grouping commands together this way allows you to\n       redirect their output as though they were one program:\n\n             { printf \" hello \" ; printf \" world\\n\" ; } > greeting\n\n       Note that \u00e2\u0080\u009c}\u00e2\u0080\u009d must follow a control operator (here, \u00e2\u0080\u009c;\u00e2\u0080\u009d) so that\n       it is recognized as a reserved word and not as another command\n       argument.\nFunctions\nThe syntax of a function definition is\nname\n()\ncommand\nA function definition is an executable statement; when executed it\n       installs a function named name and returns an exit status of zero.\n       The command is normally a list enclosed between \u00e2\u0080\u009c{\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009c}\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n       Variables may be declared to be local to a function by using a\n       local command.  This should appear as the first statement of a\n       function, and the syntax is\nlocal\n[\nvariable\n|\n-\n]\n...\nLocal is implemented as a builtin command.\n\n       When a variable is made local, it inherits the initial value and\n       exported and readonly flags from the variable with the same name\n       in the surrounding scope, if there is one.  Otherwise, the\n       variable is initially unset.  The shell uses dynamic scoping, so\n       that if you make the variable x local to function f, which then\n       calls function g, references to the variable x made inside g will\n       refer to the variable x declared inside f, not to the global\n       variable named x.\n\n       The only special parameter that can be made local is \u00e2\u0080\u009c-\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Making\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009c-\u00e2\u0080\u009d local any shell options that are changed via the set command\n       inside the function to be restored to their original values when\n       the function returns.\n\n       The syntax of the return command is\nreturn\n[\nexitstatus\n]\n\n       It terminates the currently executing function.  Return is\n       implemented as a builtin command.\nVariables and Parameters\nThe shell maintains a set of parameters.  A parameter denoted by a\n       name is called a variable.  When starting up, the shell turns all\n       the environment variables into shell variables.  New variables can\n       be set using the form\nname=value\nVariables set by the user must have a name consisting solely of\n       alphabetics, numerics, and underscores - the first of which must\n       not be numeric.  A parameter can also be denoted by a number or a\n       special character as explained below.\nPositional Parameters\nA positional parameter is a parameter denoted by a number (n > 0).\n       The shell sets these initially to the values of its command line\n       arguments that follow the name of the shell script.  The\nset\nbuiltin can also be used to set or reset them.\nSpecial Parameters\nA special parameter is a parameter denoted by one of the following\n       special characters.  The value of the parameter is listed next to\n       its character.\n\n       *            Expands to the positional parameters, starting from\n                    one.  When the expansion occurs within a double-\n                    quoted string it expands to a single field with the\n                    value of each parameter separated by the first\n                    character of the IFS variable, or by a \u00e2\u009f\u00a8space\u00e2\u009f\u00a9 if IFS\n                    is unset.\n\n       @            Expands to the positional parameters, starting from\n                    one.  When the expansion occurs within double-quotes,\n                    each positional parameter expands as a separate\n                    argument.  If there are no positional parameters, the\n                    expansion of @ generates zero arguments, even when @\n                    is double-quoted.  What this basically means, for\n                    example, is if $1 is \u00e2\u0080\u009cabc\u00e2\u0080\u009d and $2 is \u00e2\u0080\u009cdef ghi\u00e2\u0080\u009d, then\n                    \"$@\" expands to the two arguments:\n\"abc\" \"def ghi\"\n#            Expands to the number of positional parameters.\n\n       ?            Expands to the exit status of the most recent\n                    pipeline.\n\n       - (Hyphen.)  Expands to the current option flags (the single-\n                    letter option names concatenated into a string) as\n                    specified on invocation, by the set builtin command,\n                    or implicitly by the shell.\n\n       $            Expands to the process ID of the invoked shell.  A\n                    subshell retains the same value of $ as its parent.\n\n       !            Expands to the process ID of the most recent\n                    background command executed from the current shell.\n                    For a pipeline, the process ID is that of the last\n                    command in the pipeline.\n\n       0 (Zero.)    Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.\nWord Expansions\nThis clause describes the various expansions that are performed on\n       words.  Not all expansions are performed on every word, as\n       explained later.\n\n       Tilde expansions, parameter expansions, command substitutions,\n       arithmetic expansions, and quote removals that occur within a\n       single word expand to a single field.  It is only field splitting\n       or pathname expansion that can create multiple fields from a\n       single word.  The single exception to this rule is the expansion\n       of the special parameter @ within double-quotes, as was described\n       above.\n\n       The order of word expansion is:\n\n       1.   Tilde Expansion, Parameter Expansion, Command Substitution,\n            Arithmetic Expansion (these all occur at the same time).\n\n       2.   Field Splitting is performed on fields generated by step (1)\n            unless the IFS variable is null.\n\n       3.   Pathname Expansion (unless set\n-f\nis in effect).\n\n       4.   Quote Removal.\n\n       The $ character is used to introduce parameter expansion, command\n       substitution, or arithmetic evaluation.\nTilde Expansion (substituting a user's home directory)\nA word beginning with an unquoted tilde character (~) is subjected\n       to tilde expansion.  All the characters up to a slash (/) or the\n       end of the word are treated as a username and are replaced with\n       the user's home directory.  If the username is missing (as in\n~/foobar\n), the tilde is replaced with the value of the\nHOME\nvariable (the current user's home directory).\nParameter Expansion\nThe format for parameter expansion is as follows:\n${expression}\nwhere expression consists of all characters until the matching\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009c}\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Any \u00e2\u0080\u009c}\u00e2\u0080\u009d escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string,\n       and characters in embedded arithmetic expansions, command\n       substitutions, and variable expansions, are not examined in\n       determining the matching \u00e2\u0080\u009c}\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n       The simplest form for parameter expansion is:\n${parameter}\nThe value, if any, of parameter is substituted.\n\n       The parameter name or symbol can be enclosed in braces, which are\n       optional except for positional parameters with more than one digit\n       or when parameter is followed by a character that could be\n       interpreted as part of the name.  If a parameter expansion occurs\n       inside double-quotes:\n\n       1.   Pathname expansion is not performed on the results of the\n            expansion.\n\n       2.   Field splitting is not performed on the results of the\n            expansion, with the exception of @.\n\n       In addition, a parameter expansion can be modified by using one of\n       the following formats.\n\n       ${parameter:-word}    Use Default Values.  If parameter is unset\n                             or null, the expansion of word is\n                             substituted; otherwise, the value of\n                             parameter is substituted.\n\n       ${parameter:=word}    Assign Default Values.  If parameter is\n                             unset or null, the expansion of word is\n                             assigned to parameter.  In all cases, the\n                             final value of parameter is substituted.\n                             Only variables, not positional parameters or\n                             special parameters, can be assigned in this\n                             way.\n\n       ${parameter:?[word]}  Indicate Error if Null or Unset.  If\n                             parameter is unset or null, the expansion of\n                             word (or a message indicating it is unset if\n                             word is omitted) is written to standard\n                             error and the shell exits with a nonzero\n                             exit status.  Otherwise, the value of\n                             parameter is substituted.  An interactive\n                             shell need not exit.\n\n       ${parameter:+word}    Use Alternative Value.  If parameter is\n                             unset or null, null is substituted;\n                             otherwise, the expansion of word is\n                             substituted.\n\n       In the parameter expansions shown previously, use of the colon in\n       the format results in a test for a parameter that is unset or\n       null; omission of the colon results in a test for a parameter that\n       is only unset.\n\n       ${#parameter}         String Length.  The length in characters of\n                             the value of parameter.\n\n       The following four varieties of parameter expansion provide for\n       substring processing.  In each case, pattern matching notation\n       (see \u00e2\u0080\u009cShell Patterns\u00e2\u0080\u009d), rather than regular expression notation,\n       is used to evaluate the patterns.  If parameter is * or @, the\n       result of the expansion is unspecified.  Enclosing the full\n       parameter expansion string in double-quotes does not cause the\n       following four varieties of pattern characters to be quoted,\n       whereas quoting characters within the braces has this effect.\n\n       ${parameter%word}     Remove Smallest Suffix Pattern.  The word is\n                             expanded to produce a pattern.  The\n                             parameter expansion then results in\n                             parameter, with the smallest portion of the\n                             suffix matched by the pattern deleted.\n\n       ${parameter%%word}    Remove Largest Suffix Pattern.  The word is\n                             expanded to produce a pattern.  The\n                             parameter expansion then results in\n                             parameter, with the largest portion of the\n                             suffix matched by the pattern deleted.\n\n       ${parameter#word}     Remove Smallest Prefix Pattern.  The word is\n                             expanded to produce a pattern.  The\n                             parameter expansion then results in\n                             parameter, with the smallest portion of the\n                             prefix matched by the pattern deleted.\n\n       ${parameter##word}    Remove Largest Prefix Pattern.  The word is\n                             expanded to produce a pattern.  The\n                             parameter expansion then results in\n                             parameter, with the largest portion of the\n                             prefix matched by the pattern deleted.\nCommand Substitution\nCommand substitution allows the output of a command to be\n       substituted in place of the command name itself.  Command\n       substitution occurs when the command is enclosed as follows:\n$(command)\nor (\u00e2\u0080\u009cbackquoted\u00e2\u0080\u009d version):\n`command`\nThe shell expands the command substitution by executing command in\n       a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution with\n       the standard output of the command, removing sequences of one or\n       more \u00e2\u009f\u00a8newline\u00e2\u009f\u00a9s at the end of the substitution.  (Embedded\n       \u00e2\u009f\u00a8newline\u00e2\u009f\u00a9s before the end of the output are not removed; however,\n       during field splitting, they may be translated into \u00e2\u009f\u00a8space\u00e2\u009f\u00a9s,\n       depending on the value of IFS and quoting that is in effect.)\nArithmetic Expansion\nArithmetic expansion provides a mechanism for evaluating an\n       arithmetic expression and substituting its value.  The format for\n       arithmetic expansion is as follows:\n$((expression))\nThe expression is treated as if it were in double-quotes, except\n       that a double-quote inside the expression is not treated\n       specially.  The shell expands all tokens in the expression for\n       parameter expansion, command substitution, and quote removal.\n\n       Next, the shell treats this as an arithmetic expression and\n       substitutes the value of the expression.\nWhite Space Splitting (Field Splitting)\nAfter parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic\n       expansion the shell scans the results of expansions and\n       substitutions that did not occur in double-quotes for field\n       splitting and multiple fields can result.\n\n       The shell treats each character of the IFS as a delimiter and uses\n       the delimiters to split the results of parameter expansion and\n       command substitution into fields.\n\n       If IFS is empty, field splitting yields no fields if the input\n       string was empty, and one string with the unchanged value of the\n       input otherwise.  For example, with the default IFS, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nread -r\nl\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n       will remove any initial whitespace, but \u00e2\u0080\u009cIFS=\nread -r\nl\u00e2\u0080\u009d will\n       leave the entire line in l.\nPathname Expansion (File Name Generation)\nUnless the\n-f\nflag is set, file name generation is performed after\n       word splitting is complete.  Each word is viewed as a series of\n       patterns, separated by slashes.  The process of expansion replaces\n       the word with the names of all existing files whose names can be\n       formed by replacing each pattern with a string that matches the\n       specified pattern.  There are two restrictions on this: first, a\n       pattern cannot match a string containing a slash, and second, a\n       pattern cannot match a string starting with a period unless the\n       first character of the pattern is a period.  The next section\n       describes the patterns used for both Pathname Expansion and the\ncase\ncommand.\nShell Patterns\nA pattern consists of normal characters, which match themselves,\n       and meta-characters.  The meta-characters are \u00e2\u0080\u009c!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009c*\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009c?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009c[\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  These characters lose their special meanings if they are\n       quoted.  When command or variable substitution is performed and\n       the dollar sign or back quotes are not double quoted, the value of\n       the variable or the output of the command is scanned for these\n       characters and they are turned into meta-characters.\n\n       An asterisk (\u00e2\u0080\u009c*\u00e2\u0080\u009d) matches any string of characters.  A question\n       mark matches any single character.  A left bracket (\u00e2\u0080\u009c[\u00e2\u0080\u009d)\n       introduces a character class.  The end of the character class is\n       indicated by a (\u00e2\u0080\u009c]\u00e2\u0080\u009d); if the \u00e2\u0080\u009c]\u00e2\u0080\u009d is missing then the \u00e2\u0080\u009c[\u00e2\u0080\u009d matches a\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009c[\u00e2\u0080\u009d rather than introducing a character class.  A character class\n       matches any of the characters between the square brackets.  A\n       range of characters may be specified using a minus sign.  The\n       character class may be complemented by making an exclamation point\n       the first character of the character class.\n\n       To include a \u00e2\u0080\u009c]\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a character class, make it the first character\n       listed (after the \u00e2\u0080\u009c!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, if any).  To include a minus sign, make it\n       the first or last character listed.\nBuiltins\nThis section lists the builtin commands which are builtin because\n       they need to perform some operation that can't be performed by a\n       separate process.  In addition to these, there are several other\n       commands that may be builtin for efficiency (e.g.\nprintf\n(1),\necho\n(1),\ntest\n(1), etc).\n\n       :\n\n       true   A null command that returns a 0 (true) exit value.\n\n       false  A null command that returns a 1 (false) exit value.\n\n       . file\n              The commands in the specified file are read and executed by\n              the shell.\n\n       alias [\nname\n[\n=string ...\n]]\n              If\nname=string\nis specified, the shell defines the alias\nname\nwith value\nstring\n.  If just\nname\nis specified, the\n              value of the alias\nname\nis printed.  With no arguments, the\nalias\nbuiltin prints the names and values of all defined\n              aliases (see\nunalias\n).\n\n       bg [\njob\n]\n...\nContinue the specified jobs (or the current job if no jobs\n              are given) in the background.\n\n       command [\n-p\n] [\n-v\n] [\n-V\n]\ncommand\n[\narg ...\n]\n              Execute the specified command but ignore shell functions\n              when searching for it.  (This is useful when you have a\n              shell function with the same name as a builtin command.)\n-p\nsearch for command using a PATH that guarantees to\n                     find all the standard utilities.\n-V\nDo not execute the command but search for the\n                     command and print the resolution of the command\n                     search.  This is the same as the type builtin.\n-v\nDo not execute the command but search for the\n                     command and print the absolute pathname of\n                     utilities, the name for builtins or the expansion of\n                     aliases.\n\n       cd|chdir\n-\ncd|chdir [\n-LP\n] [\ndirectory\n]\n              Switch to the specified directory (default HOME).  If an\n              entry for CDPATH appears in the environment of the\ncd\ncommand or the shell variable CDPATH is set and the\n              directory name does not begin with a slash, then the\n              directories listed in CDPATH will be searched for the\n              specified directory.  The format of CDPATH is the same as\n              that of PATH.  If a single dash is specified as the\n              argument, it will be replaced by the value of OLDPWD.  The\ncd\ncommand will print out the name of the directory that it\n              actually switched to if this is different from the name\n              that the user gave.  These may be different either because\n              the CDPATH mechanism was used or because the argument is a\n              single dash.  The\n-P\noption causes the physical directory\n              structure to be used, that is, all symbolic links are\n              resolved to their respective values.  The\n-L\noption turns\n              off the effect of any preceding\n-P\noptions.\n\n       echo [\n-n\n]\nargs...\nPrint the arguments on the standard output, separated by\n              spaces.  Unless the\n-n\noption is present, a newline is\n              output following the arguments.\n\n              If any of the following sequences of characters is\n              encountered during output, the sequence is not output.\n              Instead, the specified action is performed:\n\\b\nA backspace character is output.\n\\c\nSubsequent output is suppressed.  This is normally\n                      used at the end of the last argument to suppress\n                      the trailing newline that\necho\nwould otherwise\n                      output.\n\\f\nOutput a form feed.\n\\n\nOutput a newline character.\n\\r\nOutput a carriage return.\n\\t\nOutput a (horizontal) tab character.\n\\v\nOutput a vertical tab.\n\\0\ndigits\nOutput the character whose value is given by zero\n                      to three octal digits.

Then re-parse\n              and execute the command.\n\n       exec [\ncommand arg ...\n]\n              Unless command is omitted, the shell process is replaced\n              with the specified program (which must be a real program,\n              not a shell builtin or function).  Any redirections on the\nexec\ncommand are marked as permanent, so that they are not\n              undone when the\nexec\ncommand finishes.\n\n       exit [\nexitstatus\n]\n              Terminate the shell process.  If\nexitstatus\nis given it is\n              used as the exit status of the shell; otherwise the exit\n              status of the preceding command is used.\n\n       export\nname ...\nexport\n-p\nThe specified names are exported so that they will appear\n              in the environment of subsequent commands.  The only way to\n              un-export a variable is to unset it.  The shell allows the\n              value of a variable to be set at the same time it is\n              exported by writing\nexport name=value\nWith no arguments the export command lists the names of all\n              exported variables.  With the\n-p\noption specified the\n              output will be formatted suitably for non-interactive use.\n\n       fc [\n-e\neditor\n] [\nfirst\n[\nlast\n]]\n\n       fc\n-l\n[\n-nr\n] [\nfirst\n[\nlast\n]]\n\n       fc\n-s\n[\nold=new\n] [\nfirst\n]\n              The\nfc\nbuiltin lists, or edits and re-executes, commands\n              previously entered to an interactive shell.\n-e\neditor\n                     Use the editor named by editor to edit the commands.\n                     The editor string is a command name, subject to\n                     search via the PATH variable.  The value in the\n                     FCEDIT variable is used as a default when\n-e\nis not\n                     specified.  If FCEDIT is null or unset, the value of\n                     the EDITOR variable is used.  If EDITOR is null or\n                     unset,\ned\n(1) is used as the editor.\n-l\n(ell)\n                     List the commands rather than invoking an editor on\n                     them.

If the\n                     old=new operand is not also specified with\n-s\n, the\n                     string form of the first operand cannot contain an\n                     embedded equal sign.\n\n              The following environment variables affect the execution of\n              fc:\n\n              FCEDIT    Name of the editor to use.\n\n              HISTSIZE  The number of previous commands that are\n                        accessible.\n\n       fg [\njob\n]\n              Move the specified job or the current job to the\n              foreground.\n\n       getopts\noptstring var\n[\narg ...\n]\n              The POSIX\ngetopts\ncommand, not to be confused with the\nBell\nLabs\n-derived\ngetopt\n(1).\n\n              The first argument should be a series of letters, each of\n              which may be optionally followed by a colon to indicate\n              that the option requires an argument.  The variable\n              specified is set to the parsed option.\n\n              The\ngetopts\ncommand deprecates the older\ngetopt\n(1) utility\n              due to its handling of arguments containing whitespace.\n\n              The\ngetopts\nbuiltin may be used to obtain options and their\n              arguments from a list of parameters.  When invoked,\ngetopts\nplaces the value of the next option from the option string\n              in the list in the shell variable specified by\nvar\nand its\n              index in the shell variable OPTIND.  When the shell is\n              invoked, OPTIND is initialized to 1.  For each option that\n              requires an argument, the\ngetopts\nbuiltin will place it in\n              the shell variable OPTARG.  If an option is not allowed for\n              in the\noptstring\n, then OPTARG will be unset.\n\n              By default, the variables\n$1\n,\n...\n,\n$n\nare inspected; if\narg\ns are specified, they'll be parsed instead.\noptstring\nis a string of recognized option letters (see\ngetopt\n(3)).  If a letter is followed by a colon, the option\n              is expected to have an argument which may or may not be\n              separated from it by white space.  If an option character\n              is not found where expected,\ngetopts\nwill set the variable\nvar\nto a \u00e2\u0080\u009c?\u00e2\u0080\u009d;\ngetopts\nwill then unset OPTARG and write\n              output to standard error.  By specifying a colon as the\n              first character of\noptstring\nall errors will be ignored.\n\n              After the last option\ngetopts\nwill return a non-zero value\n              and set\nvar\nto \u00e2\u0080\u009c?\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n              The following code fragment shows how one might process the\n              arguments for a command that can take the options [a] and\n              [b], and the option [c], which requires an argument.\n\n                    while getopts abc: f\n                    do\n                            case $f in\n                            a | b)  flag=$f;;\n                            c)      carg=$OPTARG;;\n                            \\?)     echo $USAGE; exit 1;;\n                            esac\n                    done\n                    shift $((OPTIND - 1))\n\n              This code will accept any of the following as equivalent:\n\n                    cmd -acarg file file\n                    cmd -a -c arg file file\n                    cmd -carg -a file file\n                    cmd -a -carg -- file file\n\n       hash [\ncommand ...\n]\n\n       hash\n-r\nThe shell maintains a hash table which remembers the\n              locations of commands.  With no arguments whatsoever, the\nhash\ncommand prints out the contents of this table.\n              Entries which have not been looked at since the last\ncd\ncommand are marked with an asterisk; it is possible for\n              these entries to be invalid.\n\n              With arguments, the\nhash\ncommand removes the specified\n              commands from the hash table (unless they are functions)\n              and then locates them.  The\n-r\noption causes the hash\n              command to delete all the entries in the hash table except\n              for functions.\n\n       jobs [\n-lp\n] [\njob ...\n]\n              Display the status of all, or just the specified,\njob\ns:\n                   By default  display the job number, currency (\n+-\n)\n                               status, if any, the job state, and its\n                               shell command.\n-l\nalso output the PID of the group leader,\n                               and just the PID and shell commands of\n                               other members of the job.\n-p\nDisplay only leader PIDs, one per line.\n\n       kill [\n-s\nsigspec\n|\n-\nsignum\n|\n-\nsigspec\n] [\npid\n|\njob ...\n]\n              Equivalent to\nkill\n(1), but a\njob\nspec may also be\n              specified.

This makes it\n              faster.  However, if the current directory is renamed, the\n              builtin version of\npwd\nwill continue to print the old name\n              for the directory.  The\n-P\noption causes the physical value\n              of the current working directory to be shown, that is, all\n              symbolic links are resolved to their respective values.\n              The\n-L\noption turns off the effect of any preceding\n-P\noptions.\n\n       read [\n-p\nprompt\n] [\n-r\n]\nvariable\n[\n...\n]\n              The prompt is printed if the\n-p\noption is specified and the\n              standard input is a terminal.  Then a line is read from the\n              standard input.  The trailing newline is deleted from the\n              line and the line is split as described in the section on\n              word splitting above, and the pieces are assigned to the\n              variables in order.  At least one variable must be\n              specified.  If there are more pieces than variables, the\n              remaining pieces (along with the characters in IFS that\n              separated them) are assigned to the last variable.  If\n              there are more variables than pieces, the remaining\n              variables are assigned the null string.  The\nread\nbuiltin\n              will indicate success unless EOF is encountered on input,\n              in which case failure is returned.\n\n              By default, unless the\n-r\noption is specified, the\n              backslash \u00e2\u0080\u009c\\\u00e2\u0080\u009d acts as an escape character, causing the\n              following character to be treated literally.  If a\n              backslash is followed by a newline, the backslash and the\n              newline will be deleted.\n\n       readonly\nname ...\nreadonly\n-p\nThe specified names are marked as read only, so that they\n              cannot be subsequently modified or unset.

The\n       current version of\ndash\nis in the process of being changed to\n       conform with the POSIX 1003.2 and 1003.2a specifications for the\n       shell.  This version has many features which make it appear\n       similar in some respects to the Korn shell, but it is not a Korn\n       shell clone (see\nksh\n(1)).  Only features designated by POSIX, plus\n       a few Berkeley extensions, are being incorporated into this shell.\n       This man page is not intended to be a tutorial or a complete\n       specification of the shell.\nOverview\nThe shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the\n       terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.\n       It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system\n       (although a user can select a different shell with the\nchsh\n(1)\n       command).  The shell implements a language that has flow control\n       constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features\n       in addition to data storage, along with built in history and line\n       editing capabilities.  It incorporates many features to aid\n       interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative\n       language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use\n       (shell scripts).  That is, commands can be typed directly to the\n       running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be\n       executed directly by the shell.\nInvocation\nIf no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is\n       connected to a terminal (or if the\n-i\nflag is set), and the\n-c\noption is not present, the shell is considered an interactive\n       shell.  An interactive shell generally prompts before each command\n       and handles programming and command errors differently (as\n       described below).  When first starting, the shell inspects\n       argument 0, and if it begins with a dash \u00e2\u0080\u0098-\u00e2\u0080\u0099, the shell is also\n       considered a login shell.  This is normally done automatically by\n       the system when the user first logs in.  A login shell first reads\n       commands from the files\n/etc/profile\nand\n.profile\nif they exist.\n       If the environment variable ENV is set on entry to an interactive\n       shell, or is set in the\n.profile\nof a login shell, the shell next\n       reads commands from the file named in ENV.  Therefore, a user\n       should place commands that are to be executed only at login time\n       in the\n.profile\nfile, and commands that are executed for every\n       interactive shell inside the ENV file.

Otherwise, the shell reads commands from its standard\n       input.\nArgument List Processing\nAll of the single letter options that have a corresponding name\n       can be used as an argument to the\n-o\noption.

(UNIMPLEMENTED\n                              for 4.4alpha)\nLexical Structure\nThe shell reads input in terms of lines from a file and breaks it\n       up into words at whitespace (blanks and tabs), and at certain\n       sequences of characters that are special to the shell called\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009coperators\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  There are two types of operators: control operators\n       and redirection operators (their meaning is discussed later).\n       Following is a list of operators:\n\n             Control operators:\n& && ( ) ; ;;\n|\n|| <newline>\nRedirection operators:\n< > >| << >> <& >& <<- <>\nQuoting\nQuoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain\n       characters or words to the shell, such as operators, whitespace,\n       or keywords.  There are three types of quoting: matched single\n       quotes, matched double quotes, and backslash.\nBackslash\nA backslash preserves the literal meaning of the following\n       character, with the exception of \u00e2\u009f\u00a8newline\u00e2\u009f\u00a9.  A backslash preceding\n       a \u00e2\u009f\u00a8newline\u00e2\u009f\u00a9 is treated as a line continuation.\nSingle Quotes\nEnclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal\n       meaning of all the characters (except single quotes, making it\n       impossible to put single-quotes in a single-quoted string).\nDouble Quotes\nEnclosing characters within double quotes preserves the literal\n       meaning of all characters except dollarsign ($), backquote (`),\n       and backslash (\\).  The backslash inside double quotes is\n       historically weird, and serves to quote only the following\n       characters:\n$ ` \" \\ <newline>\n.\n       Otherwise it remains literal.\nReserved Words\nReserved words are words that have special meaning to the shell\n       and are recognized at the beginning of a line and after a control\n       operator.  The following are reserved words:\n\n             !       elif    fi      while   case\n             else    for     then    {       }\n             do      done    until   if      esac\n\n       Their meaning is discussed later.\nAliases\nAn alias is a name and corresponding value set using the\nalias\n(1)\n       builtin command.  Whenever a reserved word may occur (see above),\n       and after checking for reserved words, the shell checks the word\n       to see if it matches an alias.  If it does, it replaces it in the\n       input stream with its value.  For example, if there is an alias\n       called \u00e2\u0080\u009clf\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the value \u00e2\u0080\u009cls -F\u00e2\u0080\u009d, then the input:\nlf foobar\n\u00e2\u009f\u00a8return\u00e2\u009f\u00a9\n\n       would become\nls -F foobar\n\u00e2\u009f\u00a8return\u00e2\u009f\u00a9\n\n       Aliases provide a convenient way for naive users to create\n       shorthands for commands without having to learn how to create\n       functions with arguments.  They can also be used to create\n       lexically obscure code.  This use is discouraged.\nCommands\nThe shell interprets the words it reads according to a language,\n       the specification of which is outside the scope of this man page\n       (refer to the BNF in the POSIX 1003.2 document).  Essentially\n       though, a line is read and if the first word of the line (or after\n       a control operator) is not a reserved word, then the shell has\n       recognized a simple command.  Otherwise, a complex command or some\n       other special construct may have been recognized.\nSimple Commands\nIf a simple command has been recognized, the shell performs the\n       following actions:\n\n             1.   Leading words of the form \u00e2\u0080\u009cname=value\u00e2\u0080\u009d are stripped off\n                  and assigned to the environment of the simple command.\n                  Redirection operators and their arguments (as described\n                  below) are stripped off and saved for processing.\n\n             2.   The remaining words are expanded as described in the\n                  section called \u00e2\u0080\u009cExpansions\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and the first remaining\n                  word is considered the command name and the command is\n                  located.  The remaining words are considered the\n                  arguments of the command.  If no command name resulted,\n                  then the \u00e2\u0080\u009cname=value\u00e2\u0080\u009d variable assignments recognized\n                  in item 1 affect the current shell.\n\n             3.   Redirections are performed as described in the next\n                  section.\nRedirections\nRedirections are used to change where a command reads its input or\n       sends its output.  In general, redirections open, close, or\n       duplicate an existing reference to a file.  The overall format\n       used for redirection is:\n[n]\nredir-op file\nwhere\nredir-op\nis one of the redirection operators mentioned\n       previously.  Following is a list of the possible redirections.\n       The [n] is an optional number between 0 and 9, as in \u00e2\u0080\u00983\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (not\n       \u00e2\u0080\u0098[3]\u00e2\u0080\u0099), that refers to a file descriptor.\n\n             [n]> file   Redirect standard output (or n) to file.\n\n             [n]>| file  Same, but override the\n-C\noption.\n\n             [n]>> file  Append standard output (or n) to file.\n\n             [n]< file   Redirect standard input (or n) from file.\n\n             [n1]<&n2    Copy file descriptor n2 as stdin (or fd n1).\n\n             [n]<&-      Close standard input (or n).\n\n             [n1]>&n2    Copy file descriptor n2 as stdout (or fd n1).\n\n             [n]>&-      Close standard output (or n).\n\n             [n]<> file  Open file for reading and writing on standard\n                         input (or n).\n\n       The following redirection is often called a \u00e2\u0080\u009chere-document\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n[n]<< delimiter\nhere-doc-text ...\ndelimiter\nAll the text on successive lines up to the delimiter is saved away\n       and made available to the command on standard input, or file\n       descriptor n if it is specified.  If the delimiter as specified on\n       the initial line is quoted, then the here-doc-text is treated\n       literally, otherwise the text is subjected to parameter expansion,\n       command substitution, and arithmetic expansion (as described in\n       the section on \u00e2\u0080\u009cExpansions\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  If the operator is \u00e2\u0080\u009c<<-\u00e2\u0080\u009d instead of\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009c<<\u00e2\u0080\u009d, then leading tabs in the here-doc-text are stripped.\nSearch and Execution\nThere are three types of commands: shell functions, builtin\n       commands, and normal programs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the command is searched for\n       (by name) in that order.  They each are executed in a different\n       way.\n\n       When a shell function is executed, all of the shell positional\n       parameters (except $0, which remains unchanged) are set to the\n       arguments of the shell function.  The variables which are\n       explicitly placed in the environment of the command (by placing\n       assignments to them before the function name) are made local to\n       the function and are set to the values given.  Then the command\n       given in the function definition is executed.  The positional\n       parameters are restored to their original values when the command\n       completes.  This all occurs within the current shell.\n\n       Shell builtins are executed internally to the shell, without\n       spawning a new process.\n\n       Otherwise, if the command name doesn't match a function or\n       builtin, the command is searched for as a normal program in the\n       file system (as described in the next section).  When a normal\n       program is executed, the shell runs the program, passing the\n       arguments and the environment to the program.  If the program is\n       not a normal executable file (i.e., if it does not begin with the\n       \"magic number\" whose ASCII representation is \"#!\", so\nexecve\n(2)\n       returns ENOEXEC then) the shell will interpret the program in a\n       subshell.  The child shell will reinitialize itself in this case,\n       so that the effect will be as if a new shell had been invoked to\n       handle the ad-hoc shell script, except that the location of hashed\n       commands located in the parent shell will be remembered by the\n       child.\n\n       Note that previous versions of this document and the source code\n       itself misleadingly and sporadically refer to a shell script\n       without a magic number as a \"shell procedure\".\nPath Search\nWhen locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a\n       shell function by that name.  Then it looks for a builtin command\n       by that name.  If a builtin command is not found, one of two\n       things happen:\n\n       1.   Command names containing a slash are simply executed without\n            performing any searches.\n\n       2.   The shell searches each entry in PATH in turn for the\n            command.  The value of the PATH variable should be a series\n            of entries separated by colons.  Each entry consists of a\n            directory name.  The current directory may be indicated\n            implicitly by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a\n            single period.\nCommand Exit Status\nEach command has an exit status that can influence the behaviour\n       of other shell commands.  The paradigm is that a command exits\n       with zero for normal or success, and non-zero for failure, error,\n       or a false indication.  The man page for each command should\n       indicate the various exit codes and what they mean.  Additionally,\n       the builtin commands return exit codes, as does an executed shell\n       function.\n\n       If a command consists entirely of variable assignments then the\n       exit status of the command is that of the last command\n       substitution if any, otherwise 0.\nComplex Commands\nComplex commands are combinations of simple commands with control\n       operators or reserved words, together creating a larger complex\n       command.  More generally, a command is one of the following:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nsimple command\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\npipeline\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nlist or compound-list\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\ncompound command\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nfunction definition\n\n       Unless otherwise stated, the exit status of a command is that of\n       the last simple command executed by the command.\nPipelines\nA pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the\n       control operator |.  The standard output of all but the last\n       command is connected to the standard input of the next command.\n       The standard output of the last command is inherited from the\n       shell, as usual.\n\n       The format for a pipeline is:\n[!] command1\n[|\ncommand2 ...]\nThe standard output of command1 is connected to the standard input\n       of command2.  The standard input, standard output, or both of a\n       command is considered to be assigned by the pipeline before any\n       redirection specified by redirection operators that are part of\n       the command.\n\n       If the pipeline is not in the background (discussed later), the\n       shell waits for all commands to complete.\n\n       If the\npipefail\noption was enabled when the shell began execution\n       of the pipeline, the pipeline's exit status is the exit status of\n       the last command specified in the pipeline that exited with non-\n       zero status, or zero if all commands in the pipeline exited with a\n       status of zero. If the\npipefail\noption was not enabled, the\n       pipeline's exit status is the exit status of the last command\n       specified in the pipeline; the exit statuses of any other commands\n       are not used. If the reserved word ! precedes the pipeline, its\n       exit status is the logical NOT of the exit status described above.\n\n       Because pipeline assignment of standard input or standard output\n       or both takes place before redirection, it can be modified by\n       redirection.  For example:\n$ command1 2>&1\n|\ncommand2\nsends both the standard output and standard error of command1 to\n       the standard input of command2.\n\n       A ; or \u00e2\u009f\u00a8newline\u00e2\u009f\u00a9 terminator causes the preceding AND-OR-list\n       (described next) to be executed sequentially; a & causes\n       asynchronous execution of the preceding AND-OR-list.\n\n       Note that unlike some other shells, each process in the pipeline\n       is a child of the invoking shell (unless it is a shell builtin, in\n       which case it executes in the current shell \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but any effect it\n       has on the environment is wiped).\nBackground Commands \u00e2\u0080\u0093 &\nIf a command is terminated by the control operator ampersand (&),\n       the shell executes the command asynchronously \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is, the shell\n       does not wait for the command to finish before executing the next\n       command.\n\n       The format for running a command in background is:\ncommand1 & [command2 & ...]\nIf the shell is not interactive, the standard input of an\n       asynchronous command is set to\n/dev/null\n.\nLists \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Generally Speaking\nA list is a sequence of zero or more commands separated by\n       newlines, semicolons, or ampersands, and optionally terminated by\n       one of these three characters.  The commands in a list are\n       executed in the order they are written.  If command is followed by\n       an ampersand, the shell starts the command and immediately\n       proceeds onto the next command; otherwise it waits for the command\n       to terminate before proceeding to the next one.\nShort-Circuit List Operators\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c&&\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009c||\u00e2\u0080\u009d are AND-OR list operators.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c&&\u00e2\u0080\u009d executes the first\n       command, and then executes the second command if and only if the\n       exit status of the first command is zero.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c||\u00e2\u0080\u009d is similar, but\n       executes the second command if and only if the exit status of the\n       first command is nonzero.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c&&\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009c||\u00e2\u0080\u009d both have the same\n       priority.\nFlow-Control Constructs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if, while, for, case\nThe syntax of the if command is\n\n             if list\n             then list\n             [ elif list\n             then    list ] ...\n             [ else list ]\n             fi\n\n       The syntax of the while command is\n\n             while list\n             do   list\n             done\n\n       The two lists are executed repeatedly while the exit status of the\n       first list is zero.  The until command is similar, but has the\n       word until in place of while, which causes it to repeat until the\n       exit status of the first list is zero.\n\n       The syntax of the for command is\n\n             for variable [ in [ word ... ] ]\n             do   list\n             done\n\n       The words following\nin\nare expanded, and then the list is executed\n       repeatedly with the variable set to each word in turn.  Omitting\n       in word ... is equivalent to in \"$@\".\n\n       The syntax of the break and continue command is\n\n             break [ num ]\n             continue [ num ]\n\n       Break terminates the num innermost for or while loops.  Continue\n       continues with the next iteration of the innermost loop.  These\n       are implemented as builtin commands.\n\n       The syntax of the case command is\n\n             case word in\n             [(]pattern) list ;;\n             ...\n             esac\n\n       The pattern can actually be one or more patterns (see \u00e2\u0080\u009cShell\n       Patterns\u00e2\u0080\u009d described later), separated by \u00e2\u0080\u009c|\u00e2\u0080\u009d characters.  The \u00e2\u0080\u009c(\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n       character before the pattern is optional.\nGrouping Commands Together\nCommands may be grouped by writing either\n(list)\nor\n{ list; }\nThe first of these executes the commands in a subshell.  Builtin\n       commands grouped into a (list) will not affect the current shell.\n       The second form does not fork another shell so is slightly more\n       efficient.  Grouping commands together this way allows you to\n       redirect their output as though they were one program:\n\n             { printf \" hello \" ; printf \" world\\n\" ; } > greeting\n\n       Note that \u00e2\u0080\u009c}\u00e2\u0080\u009d must follow a control operator (here, \u00e2\u0080\u009c;\u00e2\u0080\u009d) so that\n       it is recognized as a reserved word and not as another command\n       argument.\nFunctions\nThe syntax of a function definition is\nname\n()\ncommand\nA function definition is an executable statement; when executed it\n       installs a function named name and returns an exit status of zero.\n       The command is normally a list enclosed between \u00e2\u0080\u009c{\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009c}\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n       Variables may be declared to be local to a function by using a\n       local command.  This should appear as the first statement of a\n       function, and the syntax is\nlocal\n[\nvariable\n|\n-\n]\n...\nLocal is implemented as a builtin command.\n\n       When a variable is made local, it inherits the initial value and\n       exported and readonly flags from the variable with the same name\n       in the surrounding scope, if there is one.  Otherwise, the\n       variable is initially unset.  The shell uses dynamic scoping, so\n       that if you make the variable x local to function f, which then\n       calls function g, references to the variable x made inside g will\n       refer to the variable x declared inside f, not to the global\n       variable named x.\n\n       The only special parameter that can be made local is \u00e2\u0080\u009c-\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Making\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009c-\u00e2\u0080\u009d local any shell options that are changed via the set command\n       inside the function to be restored to their original values when\n       the function returns.\n\n       The syntax of the return command is\nreturn\n[\nexitstatus\n]\n\n       It terminates the currently executing function.  Return is\n       implemented as a builtin command.\nVariables and Parameters\nThe shell maintains a set of parameters.  A parameter denoted by a\n       name is called a variable.  When starting up, the shell turns all\n       the environment variables into shell variables.  New variables can\n       be set using the form\nname=value\nVariables set by the user must have a name consisting solely of\n       alphabetics, numerics, and underscores - the first of which must\n       not be numeric.  A parameter can also be denoted by a number or a\n       special character as explained below.\nPositional Parameters\nA positional parameter is a parameter denoted by a number (n > 0).\n       The shell sets these initially to the values of its command line\n       arguments that follow the name of the shell script.  The\nset\nbuiltin can also be used to set or reset them.\nSpecial Parameters\nA special parameter is a parameter denoted by one of the following\n       special characters.  The value of the parameter is listed next to\n       its character.\n\n       *            Expands to the positional parameters, starting from\n                    one.  When the expansion occurs within a double-\n                    quoted string it expands to a single field with the\n                    value of each parameter separated by the first\n                    character of the IFS variable, or by a \u00e2\u009f\u00a8space\u00e2\u009f\u00a9 if IFS\n                    is unset.\n\n       @            Expands to the positional parameters, starting from\n                    one.  When the expansion occurs within double-quotes,\n                    each positional parameter expands as a separate\n                    argument.  If there are no positional parameters, the\n                    expansion of @ generates zero arguments, even when @\n                    is double-quoted.  What this basically means, for\n                    example, is if $1 is \u00e2\u0080\u009cabc\u00e2\u0080\u009d and $2 is \u00e2\u0080\u009cdef ghi\u00e2\u0080\u009d, then\n                    \"$@\" expands to the two arguments:\n\"abc\" \"def ghi\"\n#            Expands to the number of positional parameters.\n\n       ?            Expands to the exit status of the most recent\n                    pipeline.\n\n       - (Hyphen.)  Expands to the current option flags (the single-\n                    letter option names concatenated into a string) as\n                    specified on invocation, by the set builtin command,\n                    or implicitly by the shell.\n\n       $            Expands to the process ID of the invoked shell.  A\n                    subshell retains the same value of $ as its parent.\n\n       !            Expands to the process ID of the most recent\n                    background command executed from the current shell.\n                    For a pipeline, the process ID is that of the last\n                    command in the pipeline.\n\n       0 (Zero.)    Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.\nWord Expansions\nThis clause describes the various expansions that are performed on\n       words.  Not all expansions are performed on every word, as\n       explained later.\n\n       Tilde expansions, parameter expansions, command substitutions,\n       arithmetic expansions, and quote removals that occur within a\n       single word expand to a single field.  It is only field splitting\n       or pathname expansion that can create multiple fields from a\n       single word.  The single exception to this rule is the expansion\n       of the special parameter @ within double-quotes, as was described\n       above.\n\n       The order of word expansion is:\n\n       1.   Tilde Expansion, Parameter Expansion, Command Substitution,\n            Arithmetic Expansion (these all occur at the same time).\n\n       2.   Field Splitting is performed on fields generated by step (1)\n            unless the IFS variable is null.\n\n       3.   Pathname Expansion (unless set\n-f\nis in effect).\n\n       4.   Quote Removal.\n\n       The $ character is used to introduce parameter expansion, command\n       substitution, or arithmetic evaluation.\nTilde Expansion (substituting a user's home directory)\nA word beginning with an unquoted tilde character (~) is subjected\n       to tilde expansion.  All the characters up to a slash (/) or the\n       end of the word are treated as a username and are replaced with\n       the user's home directory.  If the username is missing (as in\n~/foobar\n), the tilde is replaced with the value of the\nHOME\nvariable (the current user's home directory).\nParameter Expansion\nThe format for parameter expansion is as follows:\n${expression}\nwhere expression consists of all characters until the matching\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009c}\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Any \u00e2\u0080\u009c}\u00e2\u0080\u009d escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string,\n       and characters in embedded arithmetic expansions, command\n       substitutions, and variable expansions, are not examined in\n       determining the matching \u00e2\u0080\u009c}\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n       The simplest form for parameter expansion is:\n${parameter}\nThe value, if any, of parameter is substituted.\n\n       The parameter name or symbol can be enclosed in braces, which are\n       optional except for positional parameters with more than one digit\n       or when parameter is followed by a character that could be\n       interpreted as part of the name.  If a parameter expansion occurs\n       inside double-quotes:\n\n       1.   Pathname expansion is not performed on the results of the\n            expansion.\n\n       2.   Field splitting is not performed on the results of the\n            expansion, with the exception of @.\n\n       In addition, a parameter expansion can be modified by using one of\n       the following formats.\n\n       ${parameter:-word}    Use Default Values.  If parameter is unset\n                             or null, the expansion of word is\n                             substituted; otherwise, the value of\n                             parameter is substituted.\n\n       ${parameter:=word}    Assign Default Values.  If parameter is\n                             unset or null, the expansion of word is\n                             assigned to parameter.  In all cases, the\n                             final value of parameter is substituted.\n                             Only variables, not positional parameters or\n                             special parameters, can be assigned in this\n                             way.\n\n       ${parameter:?[word]}  Indicate Error if Null or Unset.  If\n                             parameter is unset or null, the expansion of\n                             word (or a message indicating it is unset if\n                             word is omitted) is written to standard\n                             error and the shell exits with a nonzero\n                             exit status.  Otherwise, the value of\n                             parameter is substituted.  An interactive\n                             shell need not exit.\n\n       ${parameter:+word}    Use Alternative Value.  If parameter is\n                             unset or null, null is substituted;\n                             otherwise, the expansion of word is\n                             substituted.\n\n       In the parameter expansions shown previously, use of the colon in\n       the format results in a test for a parameter that is unset or\n       null; omission of the colon results in a test for a parameter that\n       is only unset.\n\n       ${#parameter}         String Length.  The length in characters of\n                             the value of parameter.\n\n       The following four varieties of parameter expansion provide for\n       substring processing.  In each case, pattern matching notation\n       (see \u00e2\u0080\u009cShell Patterns\u00e2\u0080\u009d), rather than regular expression notation,\n       is used to evaluate the patterns.  If parameter is * or @, the\n       result of the expansion is unspecified.  Enclosing the full\n       parameter expansion string in double-quotes does not cause the\n       following four varieties of pattern characters to be quoted,\n       whereas quoting characters within the braces has this effect.\n\n       ${parameter%word}     Remove Smallest Suffix Pattern.  The word is\n                             expanded to produce a pattern.  The\n                             parameter expansion then results in\n                             parameter, with the smallest portion of the\n                             suffix matched by the pattern deleted.\n\n       ${parameter%%word}    Remove Largest Suffix Pattern.  The word is\n                             expanded to produce a pattern.  The\n                             parameter expansion then results in\n                             parameter, with the largest portion of the\n                             suffix matched by the pattern deleted.\n\n       ${parameter#word}     Remove Smallest Prefix Pattern.  The word is\n                             expanded to produce a pattern.  The\n                             parameter expansion then results in\n                             parameter, with the smallest portion of the\n                             prefix matched by the pattern deleted.\n\n       ${parameter##word}    Remove Largest Prefix Pattern.  The word is\n                             expanded to produce a pattern.  The\n                             parameter expansion then results in\n                             parameter, with the largest portion of the\n                             prefix matched by the pattern deleted.\nCommand Substitution\nCommand substitution allows the output of a command to be\n       substituted in place of the command name itself.  Command\n       substitution occurs when the command is enclosed as follows:\n$(command)\nor (\u00e2\u0080\u009cbackquoted\u00e2\u0080\u009d version):\n`command`\nThe shell expands the command substitution by executing command in\n       a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution with\n       the standard output of the command, removing sequences of one or\n       more \u00e2\u009f\u00a8newline\u00e2\u009f\u00a9s at the end of the substitution.  (Embedded\n       \u00e2\u009f\u00a8newline\u00e2\u009f\u00a9s before the end of the output are not removed; however,\n       during field splitting, they may be translated into \u00e2\u009f\u00a8space\u00e2\u009f\u00a9s,\n       depending on the value of IFS and quoting that is in effect.)\nArithmetic Expansion\nArithmetic expansion provides a mechanism for evaluating an\n       arithmetic expression and substituting its value.  The format for\n       arithmetic expansion is as follows:\n$((expression))\nThe expression is treated as if it were in double-quotes, except\n       that a double-quote inside the expression is not treated\n       specially.  The shell expands all tokens in the expression for\n       parameter expansion, command substitution, and quote removal.\n\n       Next, the shell treats this as an arithmetic expression and\n       substitutes the value of the expression.\nWhite Space Splitting (Field Splitting)\nAfter parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic\n       expansion the shell scans the results of expansions and\n       substitutions that did not occur in double-quotes for field\n       splitting and multiple fields can result.\n\n       The shell treats each character of the IFS as a delimiter and uses\n       the delimiters to split the results of parameter expansion and\n       command substitution into fields.\n\n       If IFS is empty, field splitting yields no fields if the input\n       string was empty, and one string with the unchanged value of the\n       input otherwise.  For example, with the default IFS, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\nread -r\nl\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n       will remove any initial whitespace, but \u00e2\u0080\u009cIFS=\nread -r\nl\u00e2\u0080\u009d will\n       leave the entire line in l.\nPathname Expansion (File Name Generation)\nUnless the\n-f\nflag is set, file name generation is performed after\n       word splitting is complete.  Each word is viewed as a series of\n       patterns, separated by slashes.  The process of expansion replaces\n       the word with the names of all existing files whose names can be\n       formed by replacing each pattern with a string that matches the\n       specified pattern.  There are two restrictions on this: first, a\n       pattern cannot match a string containing a slash, and second, a\n       pattern cannot match a string starting with a period unless the\n       first character of the pattern is a period.  The next section\n       describes the patterns used for both Pathname Expansion and the\ncase\ncommand.\nShell Patterns\nA pattern consists of normal characters, which match themselves,\n       and meta-characters.  The meta-characters are \u00e2\u0080\u009c!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009c*\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009c?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009c[\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  These characters lose their special meanings if they are\n       quoted.  When command or variable substitution is performed and\n       the dollar sign or back quotes are not double quoted, the value of\n       the variable or the output of the command is scanned for these\n       characters and they are turned into meta-characters.\n\n       An asterisk (\u00e2\u0080\u009c*\u00e2\u0080\u009d) matches any string of characters.  A question\n       mark matches any single character.  A left bracket (\u00e2\u0080\u009c[\u00e2\u0080\u009d)\n       introduces a character class.  The end of the character class is\n       indicated by a (\u00e2\u0080\u009c]\u00e2\u0080\u009d); if the \u00e2\u0080\u009c]\u00e2\u0080\u009d is missing then the \u00e2\u0080\u009c[\u00e2\u0080\u009d matches a\n       \u00e2\u0080\u009c[\u00e2\u0080\u009d rather than introducing a character class.  A character class\n       matches any of the characters between the square brackets.  A\n       range of characters may be specified using a minus sign.  The\n       character class may be complemented by making an exclamation point\n       the first character of the character class.\n\n       To include a \u00e2\u0080\u009c]\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a character class, make it the first character\n       listed (after the \u00e2\u0080\u009c!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, if any).  To include a minus sign, make it\n       the first or last character listed.\nBuiltins\nThis section lists the builtin commands which are builtin because\n       they need to perform some operation that can't be performed by a\n       separate process.  In addition to these, there are several other\n       commands that may be builtin for efficiency (e.g.\nprintf\n(1),\necho\n(1),\ntest\n(1), etc).\n\n       :\n\n       true   A null command that returns a 0 (true) exit value.\n\n       false  A null command that returns a 1 (false) exit value.\n\n       . file\n              The commands in the specified file are read and executed by\n              the shell.\n\n       alias [\nname\n[\n=string ...\n]]\n              If\nname=string\nis specified, the shell defines the alias\nname\nwith value\nstring\n.  If just\nname\nis specified, the\n              value of the alias\nname\nis printed.  With no arguments, the\nalias\nbuiltin prints the names and values of all defined\n              aliases (see\nunalias\n).\n\n       bg [\njob\n]\n...\nContinue the specified jobs (or the current job if no jobs\n              are given) in the background.\n\n       command [\n-p\n] [\n-v\n] [\n-V\n]\ncommand\n[\narg ...\n]\n              Execute the specified command but ignore shell functions\n              when searching for it.  (This is useful when you have a\n              shell function with the same name as a builtin command.)\n-p\nsearch for command using a PATH that guarantees to\n                     find all the standard utilities.\n-V\nDo not execute the command but search for the\n                     command and print the resolution of the command\n                     search.  This is the same as the type builtin.\n-v\nDo not execute the command but search for the\n                     command and print the absolute pathname of\n                     utilities, the name for builtins or the expansion of\n                     aliases.\n\n       cd|chdir\n-\ncd|chdir [\n-LP\n] [\ndirectory\n]\n              Switch to the specified directory (default HOME).  If an\n              entry for CDPATH appears in the environment of the\ncd\ncommand or the shell variable CDPATH is set and the\n              directory name does not begin with a slash, then the\n              directories listed in CDPATH will be searched for the\n              specified directory.  The format of CDPATH is the same as\n              that of PATH.  If a single dash is specified as the\n              argument, it will be replaced by the value of OLDPWD.  The\ncd\ncommand will print out the name of the directory that it\n              actually switched to if this is different from the name\n              that the user gave.  These may be different either because\n              the CDPATH mechanism was used or because the argument is a\n              single dash.  The\n-P\noption causes the physical directory\n              structure to be used, that is, all symbolic links are\n              resolved to their respective values.

The only way to\n              un-export a variable is to unset it.  The shell allows the\n              value of a variable to be set at the same time it is\n              exported by writing\nexport name=value\nWith no arguments the export command lists the names of all\n              exported variables.

The variable\n              specified is set to the parsed option.\n\n              The\ngetopts\ncommand deprecates the older\ngetopt\n(1) utility\n              due to its handling of arguments containing whitespace.\n\n              The\ngetopts\nbuiltin may be used to obtain options and their\n              arguments from a list of parameters.

When the shell is\n              invoked, OPTIND is initialized to 1.  For each option that\n              requires an argument, the\ngetopts\nbuiltin will place it in\n              the shell variable OPTARG.

The\n-P\noption causes the physical value\n              of the current working directory to be shown, that is, all\n              symbolic links are resolved to their respective values.\n              The\n-L\noption turns off the effect of any preceding\n-P\noptions.\n\n       read [\n-p\nprompt\n] [\n-r\n]\nvariable\n[\n...\n]\n              The prompt is printed if the\n-p\noption is specified and the\n              standard input is a terminal.  Then a line is read from the\n              standard input.  The trailing newline is deleted from the\n              line and the line is split as described in the section on\n              word splitting above, and the pieces are assigned to the\n              variables in order.  At least one variable must be\n              specified.  If there are more pieces than variables, the\n              remaining pieces (along with the characters in IFS that\n              separated them) are assigned to the last variable.  If\n              there are more variables than pieces, the remaining\n              variables are assigned the null string.

This mode uses\n       commands, described below, similar to a subset of those described\n       in the vi man page.  The command \u00e2\u0080\u0098set -o vi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 enables vi-mode\n       editing and places sh into vi insert mode.  With vi-mode enabled,\n       sh can be switched between insert mode and command mode.  It is\n       similar to vi: typing \u00e2\u009f\u00a8ESC\u00e2\u009f\u00a9 enters vi command mode.  Hitting\n       \u00e2\u009f\u00a8return\u00e2\u009f\u00a9 while in command mode will pass the line to the shell.\nRelevant sections:\n- \n\n---\n\nCommand: find\nDescription: The\nfind\nutility shall recursively descend the directory hierarchy\n       from each file specified by\npath\n, evaluating a Boolean expression\n       composed of the primaries described in the OPERANDS section for\n       each file encountered. Each\npath\noperand shall be evaluated\n       unaltered as it was provided, including all trailing <slash>\n       characters; all pathnames for other files encountered in the\n       hierarchy shall consist of the concatenation of the current\npath\noperand, a <slash> if the current\npath\noperand did not end in one,\n       and the filename relative to the\npath\noperand. The relative\n       portion shall contain no dot or dot-dot components, no trailing\n       <slash> characters, and only single <slash> characters between\n       pathname components.\n\n       The\nfind\nutility shall be able to descend to arbitrary depths in a\n       file hierarchy and shall not fail due to path length limitations\n       (unless a\npath\noperand specified by the application exceeds\n       {PATH_MAX} requirements).\n\n       The\nfind\nutility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a\n       previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file\n       encountered.
